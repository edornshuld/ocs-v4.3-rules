          <h1>14.0 Air Power</h1>

          <div class="article-style">
            <hr>
<p>In very general terms, “Active” aircraft
execute missions from their Air Bases
to hexes within their range. A player’s
Active aircraft can perform missions in
friendly Movement, Exploitation, and
Reaction Phases. Air units never need
Reserve markers.</p>
<p>Mission types include Barrage (hitting
enemy facilities or units), Fighter Sweeps
(cleaning out enemy aircraft), Interception 
(disrupting enemy missions),
Air Transport (hauling ground units
to another Air Base), Air Drop (doing
the same to a hex without a base), and
Transfer (moving to a new base).</p>
<p>When executing a mission, follow the
sequence given in <a href="#142-aircraft-movement">14.2f</a> and then have
the planes become “Inactive” at an Air
Base before executing the next mission.
During a future Refit Phase, Inactive
planes can become Active once more.</p>
<h2 id="141-aircraft--basic-handling">14.1 Aircraft &amp; Basic Handling</h2>
<p>Air units represent groups of specific
planes (such as Bf-109s) that are rated
for Type, Range, Air Combat Rating,
Barrage Strength, and (sometimes) Air
Transport Capacity. While an aircraft
unit represents roughly 45 aircraft, it is
assumed the operational rate of these is
well under 100%. The game uses five
types of aircraft:</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Fighters (F)</strong> are the only air
units able to fly Interception
missions and attack during
Air Combat. Active Fighters
also exert a “Patrol Zone”
that interferes with enemy
air missions.</p>

  </div></figure>
</p>
<p><strong>Combo Types</strong> are two types
in one, usually T and Tpt.
These units can function as
either listed type.</p>
<p><strong>14.1a Active and Inactive Aircraft.</strong>
Aircraft have two modes: Active or Inactive.
An aircraft’s mode is shown by it
being above (Active) or below (Inactive)
the Air Base counter. Basically, Active
aircraft can conduct missions and Inactive
ones cannot. Active aircraft in a
friendly Air Base hex can remain Active
indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>14.1b Aircraft Step Losses.</strong> Aircraft
have <strong>two</strong> steps each. Use the reverse
(reduced) side of the counter to show a
step loss. Aircraft which take a second
step loss are eliminated and placed in
the Dead Pile.</p>
<p><strong>14.1c Aborts &amp; Return to Base.</strong> Air
units that execute a mission (see <a href="#142-aircraft-movement">14.2f</a>)
or “abort” from air combat must return
to a friendly air base within their range
and become Inactive. (<strong>Exceptions</strong>: A
Fighter remains Active after completing
a successful Interception (<a href="#145-interception">14.5</a>), and
after a Base Transfer (<a href="#1411-base-transfer">14.11</a>) done at
normal range.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Aircraft that abort before/during an
Air Combat over a friendly air base
must return to <strong>that</strong> base. (<strong>Exception:</strong> 
see <a href="#145-interception">14.5</a> for special handling
of Interceptors.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14.1d Refit.</strong> Refit (<a href="../15-0-air-bases/">15.0</a>) is needed to
keep aircraft in action (think of it as
fueling and routine maintenance). It
is how Inactive aircraft become Active.
Refit is the only time aircraft need or
consume supply.</p>
<p><strong>14.1e Strategic Bombers.</strong> Missions that
include Strategic Bombers suffer several
limitations due to their high-altitude
operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A)</strong> Barrages are always considered to
be unspotted.</li>
<li><strong>B)</strong> Hip Shoots and anti-ship barrage
missions are never allowed.</li>
<li><strong>C)</strong> The short-range barrage shift is
never received.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14.1f Weather.</strong> Weather can inhibit
air operations, restricting missions to
certain phases and sometimes allowing
“no flight” at all. During weather when
missions cannot be flown, Active air
units remain Active and aircraft can
be refit.</p>
<p><strong>14.1g Phasing.</strong> Active planes can fly
missions during friendly Movement,
Exploitation, and Reaction Phases.</p>
<h2 id="142-aircraft-movement">14.2 Aircraft Movement</h2>
<p>Aircraft have stacking limits and move
by being lifted directly from their air
base to the mission’s target hex. Aircraft
move in various phases and segments,
depending on the mission.</p>
<p><strong>14.2a Aircraft Stacking.</strong> Count each air
unit (whether reduced or full-strength)
as one unit for stacking. A maximum
of four <strong>Active</strong> aircraft can execute a
mission together. On a friendly Air Base,
a maximum of four friendly aircraft <strong>plus</strong>
the Air Base Level can be Active at one
time (so, a Level 3 Air Base can have a
total of seven Active aircraft). There is no
limit to the number of Inactive aircraft
that can stack at a base.</p>
<p><strong>14.2b</strong> A player can voluntarily abort
planes in a hex to avoid an Air Combat
before it starts, but at least one air unit
must stay Active and fight. See <a href="#143-air-combat">14.3d</a>.</p>
<p><strong>14.2c Aircraft Movement.</strong> An Active
air unit voluntarily moves only when
conducting a mission. When an Air Base
is captured by enemy ground units, all
air units at the base are displaced (and
possibly suffer a loss) per <a href="../9-0-ground-combat/#914-specialized-combats">9.14f</a>.</p>
<p><strong>14.2d</strong> An aircraft’s range is the limit it
can travel (in hexes) when flying either
to a mission hex or returning from one.
Aircraft move by simply placing them in
any hex within range, without regard to
terrain or enemy units. There is no need
to trace a specific path.</p>
<p><strong>14.2e Air Missions.</strong> Active planes can
perform the following missions. Aircraft
can not perform a combined air mission
(such as “Sweep then Barrage”) and can
only fly a single mission per phase. For
each mission, follow the Air Movement
Sequence (<a href="#142-aircraft-movement">14.2f</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong> “Mission aircraft”
means the air units that are performing
a mission. Missions are never restricted
to aircraft of a certain type. For instance,
a Fighter is allowed to take part in an
Air Transport mission.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interception (<a href="#145-interception">14.5</a>).</strong> The ability to
‘jump’ enemy air units before they
perform their mission.</li>
<li><strong>Fighter Sweep (<a href="#146-fighter-sweep">14.6</a>).</strong> A Fighter
Sweep is designed to engage enemy
planes in air combat. Fighter Sweeps
are executed in the various Movement Segments.</li>
<li><strong>Barrage (<a href="#147-barrage--hip-shoots">14.7</a>).</strong> A Barrage is an air
attack on enemy facilities or ground
units. Barrage missions are executed
in the various Barrage Segments.</li>
<li><strong>Hip Shoot (<a href="#147-barrage--hip-shoots">14.7d</a>).</strong> A Hip Shoot is
a special type of barrage made during
a Movement Segment instead of a
Barrage Segment. Hip Shoots also
allow the same hex to be hit more
than once in a single phase. Only
certain air forces can do Hip Shoots,
however, and this will be noted in
game-specific rules.</li>
<li><strong>Trainbusting (<a href="#148-trainbusting">14.8</a>).</strong> This allows
aircraft to interdict enemy ground
and rail movement. Trainbusting
missions are executed during the
various Barrage Segments.</li>
<li><strong>Air Transportation (<a href="#149-air-transport">14.9</a>)</strong> and <strong>Air Drop 
(<a href="#1410-air-drop">14.10</a>)</strong>. The delivery of cargo
(combat units or SP) by air, either
by unloading them at an Air Base
or dropping them in some other
hex. Air Transport and Air Drop
Missions are executed in the various
Movement Segments.</li>
<li><strong>Base Transfer (<a href="#1411-base-transfer">14.11</a>).</strong> Movement
of your aircraft from one Air Base
to another. Transfers are executed
in the various Movement Segments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> There are no limits
placed on the number of non-barrage
missions that can be flown to the same
hex in a phase. For instance, a player
wanting to Air Drop 1T of supply to
a surrounded tank division could keep
flying mission after mission until he
successfully lands the needed supplies. A
player could also Hip Shoot a hex several
times in the phase. Other barrages are
limited to one to a hex each phase.</p>
<p><strong>14.2f Air Mission Sequence.</strong> Follow
this complete sequence when executing
a mission. Aircraft from more than one
Air Base (up to a combined limit of four
air units) can execute a mission together,
with air units from each base moving
separately (there is no need to “link up”
before reaching target hex):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A)</strong> Declare the mission type (such as
Trainbusting or Barrage).</li>
<li><strong>B)</strong> Move aircraft from one or more
bases to the mission hex.</li>
<li><strong>C)</strong> Resolve any Air Combat (<a href="#143-air-combat">14.3</a>) if
both players have Active aircraft
in the mission hex.</li>
<li><strong>D)</strong> Resolve any Interception (<a href="#145-interception">14.5</a>).</li>
<li><strong>E)</strong> Resolve any Flak (<a href="#144-flak">14.4</a>).</li>
<li><strong>F)</strong> Resolve the mission.</li>
<li><strong>G)</strong> The aircraft return to base (<a href="#141-aircraft--basic-handling">14.1c</a>)
and usually become Inactive.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Play Note:</strong> Planes can no longer be added
to a mission after Step C, so remember to
perform needed Fighter Sweeps during the
Movement Segment!</em></p>
<h2 id="143-air-combat">14.3 Air Combat</h2>
<p>When both sides have Active planes
in a hex, Air Combat is immediately
resolved. This will only happen when
the mission hex has an enemy air base
with Active aircraft, or during Interception 
(<a href="#145-interception">14.5</a>). An Air Combat consists of
a series of rounds during which each
player selects one unit to use. The result
of the round will be the abort (see <a href="#141-aircraft--basic-handling">14.1c</a>)
and possible loss of one or both of the
selected aircraft. These rounds continue
until one side or the other is alone in the
hex (or there are no Active planes left
with a non-parenthesized Air Combat
Rating).</p>
<p>Ignore all Inactive aircraft during Air
Combat; they do not take part at all.</p>
<p><strong>14.3a Parenthesized Ratings.</strong> Aircraft
with parenthesized Air Combat Ratings
<strong>cannot</strong> initiate Air Combat. They can
still enter a hex with enemy aircraft,
however. If all the aircraft in a hex (both
sides) have parenthesized Air Combat
Ratings, the aircraft ignore one another
(and there is no Air Combat).</p>
<p><strong>14.3b Modifiers to Air Combat.</strong> There
are none except when using the Long
Range option (<a href="../21-0-optional-rules/#214-long-range-air---b">21.4</a>).</p>
<p><strong>14.3c Attacker Identification.</strong> In Air
Combat the “attacker” will normally be
the player initiating the battle (mission
player or Interceptor). The roles switch
if the erstwhile “attacker” only has air
units with Parenthesized Ratings, and
the combat ends completely if all Active
planes in the hex have Parenthesized
Ratings—the remaining planes ignore
each other and the mission continues.</p>
<p><strong>14.3d Voluntary Aborts.</strong> Voluntarily
Aborting from an Air Combat (thus
becoming Inactive) is sometimes useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A)</strong> Either player has the option to
abort some of his aircraft in the
hex before the Air Combat starts,
but at least one air unit <strong>must</strong> be
kept Active and fight.</li>
<li><strong>B)</strong> Neither player has the option to
abort after an Air Combat starts.
(It continues until only one player
has Active aircraft in the hex, or
both sides run out of non-paren-
thesized aircraft.)</li>
<li><strong>C)</strong> Active air units can voluntarily
abort after completely finishing
an Air Combat.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14.3e Air Combat Procedure.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A)</strong> Both players lay out their aircraft
in plain view. Voluntary aborts
(14.3d) are made now.</li>
<li><strong>B)</strong> The attacker (<a href="#143-air-combat">14.3c</a>) selects one of
his non-parenthesized air units,
then the defender selects any of
his air units. These are the aircraft
used in the current combat round.</li>
<li><strong>C)</strong> The attacker rolls two dice, adding
it to his Air Combat Rating, and
then subtracting the defending Air
Combat Rating. Use this modified
roll on the Air Combat Table to
identify which aircraft, either one
or both, must abort. Finally, roll
a third die—the “loss” die—to
determine if the aborted unit(s)
must also take a step loss. This
happens on a roll of 5 or 6.</li>
<li><strong>D)</strong> Repeat B and C (each couplet is a
round of combat) with the same
or different aircraft until one side
or the other remains alone in the
hex (or until neither player has any
Active Fighters left).</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Play Hint:</strong> Roll three dice at once—two
“combat” dice and an off-colored “loss”
die—to speed Air Combat resolution.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Example:</strong> One LaGG-3 (Air Combat
Rating of 2) and one IL-2 Air Combat
Rating of (2)) move into a German Air
Base hex occupied by one Active Bf 109f
(Air Combat Rating of 4) and two Stukas
(Air Combat Rating of (1)) along with
several Inactive aircraft. All of the above
are at full strength. The Soviets are the
attackers.</em></p>
<p><em>Each player selects the aircraft of his choice
for the first round of Air Combat. The
Soviets select the LaGG-3; the Germans
pick the Bf 109f. The defending Germans
could also have picked one of the Stukas
(not a bright move, but allowed). The
attacking Soviets could not have picked
the IL-2 because of its parenthesized Air
Combat Rating. The Soviet player rolls
two dice (getting a 9) to which he adds
his aircraft’s rating (2) and subtracts the
German unit’s rating (4) for a modified
roll of 7. The Air Combat Table gives
“Both Abort.” The Soviet player rolls one
die and no losses result, so both players
send their aircraft back to base where they
become Inactive.</em></p>
<p><em>This leaves the two Stukas facing the IL-2.
None of these can attack, so the combat
ends and the two forces ignore each other.
The Soviets can then barrage the Air Base.</em></p>
<h2 id="144-flak">14.4 Flak</h2>
<p>In Step E of the Air Mission Sequence
(<a href="#142-aircraft-movement">14.2f</a>), the enemy player checks to see
if his abstracted air defenses (“Flak”)
disrupt the mission. Normal Flak reflects
only ground-to-air fires—most combat
units have some anti-aircraft ability,
and the design also assumes nominal
Flak assets are deployed at important
potential targets. The intensity of ground
Flak is increased if the mission is flown
into an enemy Patrol Zone (<a href="#144-flak">14.4a</a>).</p>
<p><strong>14.4a Missions Subject to Flak.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Always:</strong> Barrage, Hip Shoot, and
Trainbusting.</li>
<li><strong>Only if in an enemy Patrol Zone:</strong>
Air Transport, Air Drop, and Base
Transfer.</li>
<li><strong>Never:</strong> Fighter Sweep and Interception, 
and all non-mission activity
(such as placing air reinforcements
and returning to an air base).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14.4b</strong> Supply considerations never affect
Flak, nor is there any SP cost for Flak
rolls.</p>
<p><strong>14.4c</strong> Patrol Zone. A Patrol Zone (PZ)
is a defensive area created by any Air
Base with one or more Active Fighters,
and extends 10 hexes in all directions.
Enemy air missions that target a hex in
a PZ are subject to Interception (<a href="#145-interception">14.5</a>)
and heavier Flak.</p>
<p><strong>14.4d Non-Mission Aircraft.</strong> Extra air
units will sometimes be stacked with
mission aircraft. For instance, an Active
aircraft might be at a friendly Air Base
receiving a Transport mission. Only
mission aircraft are affected by Flak.
(But note any “extra” planes would be
affected by Interception, taking part in
the Air Combat along with the mission
aircraft.)</p>
<p><strong>14.4e Flak Resolution.</strong> Roll two dice.
If the modified result is 11 or more, one
mission aircraft step is lost. Otherwise,
the Flak has no effect and resolution is
complete.</p>
<p>The dice roll is modified by the Flak
Points affecting the mission, per the
charts and tables.</p>
<p><strong>14.4f Flak Losses.</strong> If a loss is inflicted,
one of the mission aircraft takes a loss
<strong>before</strong> conducting the mission. Other-
wise, the Flak has no effect. Determine
which air unit in a stack takes the loss by
using the Mission Loss Table. Remove
an eliminated aircraft; those with one
step remaining finish the mission using
their reduced values.</p>
<p><strong>14.4g Cargo Losses.</strong> If there is a change
in a Transport mission’s cargo capacity
because of Flak, recalculate the avail-
able load (keeping in mind range effects
of <a href="#149-air-transport">14.9e</a>) and destroy a portion of the
cargo (player’s choice) that exceeds the
new capacity. Round in <strong>favor</strong> of cargo
survival (e.g. if 1T is being transported
and the aircraft drops from 1T to 1/2T
capability, the 1T survives and arrives
successfully).</p>
<h2 id="145-interception">14.5 Interception</h2>
<p>In Step D of the Air Mission Sequence
(<a href="#142-aircraft-movement">14.2f</a>), a player will sometimes have the
option to intercept an enemy mission.
Only a mission that is subject to Flak
(per <a href="#144-flak">14.4a</a>) can be intercepted, and then
only if the mission hex is in a Patrol
Zone. The player can intercept with a
single Active Fighter with a Patrol Zone
into the mission hex. The player is not
required to intercept (it is his option)
and can only do so once per mission.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Interception missions
are never prevented by game-specific
weather and/or phase restrictions.</p>
<p>Interception is resolved as Air Combat.
If non-mission aircraft are present, see
<a href="#144-flak">14.4d</a>. Handle the intercepting Fighter
after the combat as a special case:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the interceptor loses, it becomes
Inactive at the air base from which
it came.</li>
<li>If the interceptor wins, it stays
Active at the air base from which it
came. The plane is <strong>not</strong> considered
to have flown a mission and thus is
eligible to intercept another enemy
mission later in the same phase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="146-fighter-sweep">14.6 Fighter Sweep</h2>
<p>Fighter Sweep missions are done during
Movement Segments. In these a Fighter
is moved to a hex with Active enemy
aircraft and engages in Air Combat. Win
or lose, the mission Fighter is aborted
to an air base within range when the
rounds of combat conclude. A hex can
be the target of any number of Fighter
Sweeps in the same segment.</p>
<p><em><strong>Play Note:</strong> There is no reason to have
more than one fighter per Sweep mission,
since multiple Sweeps can be flown against
the same hex.</em></p>
<h2 id="147-barrage--hip-shoots">14.7 Barrage &amp; Hip Shoots</h2>
<p>Aircraft make use of Barrage missions to
attack enemy ships, ground units, and
facilities. What follows are the specifics
of Barrage missions; <a href="../10-0-barrage/">10.0</a> covers the
more general rules of Barrage and <a href="../18-0-naval-power/#183-naval-combat">18.3</a>
describes anti-ship barrages. All the usual
modifiers for Barrage (including spotters) 
apply to air barrages as well.</p>
<p>A given hex can normally be barraged
just once in a phase, but Hip Shoots do
not count against this limit.</p>
<p><strong>14.7a</strong> Aircraft <strong>can never combine</strong> with
artillery or ships in a single barrage. An
Air Barrage never has any supply cost
of its own.</p>
<p><strong>14.7b Air Barrage and Phasing.</strong> Air
units move to a mission hex during a
Barrage Segment. Follow the sequence
given in <a href="#142-aircraft-movement">14.2f</a>. Aircraft are subject to
Flak (see <a href="#144-flak">14.4</a>) before the barrage, and
<strong>must</strong> return to an air base and become
Inactive immediately after the barrage
is resolved.</p>
<p><strong>14.7c Short Range Barrage Modifier.</strong>
Range effects apply when all aircraft
conducting the barrage are at or within
10 hexes of the base from which they
flew. These barrages get an additional
rightward shift on the Barrage Table.
<strong>Never</strong> apply this shift to Strat Bombers.</p>
<p><strong>14.7d Hip Shoots.</strong> Hip Shoots are done
during Movement Segments. They are
resolved like normal Barrages (<a href="#147-barrage--hip-shoots">14.7</a>),
with some exceptions and restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A)</strong> Hip Shoots do not count against
the limit of one barrage against
a hex in a phase. This means a
hex can be barraged by multiple
Hip Shoots in a phase, and also
be subjected to a “regular” barrage
during the same phase.</li>
<li><strong>B)</strong> A Hip Shoot must be made by a
<strong>single</strong> aircraft and its nationality
<strong>must</strong> be listed in the game-specific
rulebook as having the special Hip
Shoot capability.</li>
<li><strong>C)</strong> A Hip Shoot *<strong>requires</strong> a correct
spotter (<a href="../10-0-barrage/">10.0b</a>).</li>
<li><strong>D)</strong> Given the above, a Hip Shoot can
hit any <strong>type</strong> of target. (<strong>Exception</strong>:
Trainbusting cannot be performed
as a Hip Shoot.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="148-trainbusting">14.8 Trainbusting</h2>
<p>Trainbusting missions disrupt enemy
rail traffic as well as columns of troops,
vehicles, and pack animals moving in
an area. Only one Trainbusting mission
per hex per phase is allowed, and only
one Trainbusting marker can be placed
in any hex. These missions cannot be
executed as Hip Shoots.</p>
<p><strong>14.8a Execution.</strong> Move the mission
stack to the target hex. Resolve Flak
(see <a href="#144-flak">14.4</a>) and then attack the hex using
the Barrage vs. Facility Table. If the
result contains an asterisk, place a Trainbusting 
marker in the hex (otherwise
there is no effect). Regardless of success,
the aircraft return to base and become
Inactive.</p>
<p><strong>14.8b Trainbusting Zone.</strong></p>
<p>















<figure  >
  <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
    <div class="w-100" ><img src="/rules/ocs-4.3/files/trainbusting-14.8b.png" alt="" loading="lazy" data-zoomable /></div>
  </div></figure>
</p>
<p>A Trainbusting 
Zone (TZ) is the hex
with a Trainbusting marker
plus the six adjacent hexes.
(<strong>Exception</strong>: For movement
using Leg MP, a Trainbusting Zone is
limited to just the marker’s hex.)</p>
<p><strong>14.8c Trainbusting Effects.</strong> The Trainbusting 
Zone affects enemy ground unit
movement and rail costs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ground units must add 1 MP to the
terrain cost of every hex entered that
is in a TZ.</li>
<li>Rail cargo passing through a TZ
uses double the normal Rail Cap.
The increase in cost is applied only
once, even if the cargo is transported
in and/or out of multiple TZ.</li>
<li>Ships, aircraft, sea cap, and supply
paths are unaffected by a TZ.
Note there is never an additional effect
on a hex due to overlapping TZ, and a
TZ has no effect on retreats.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14.8d Phasing.</strong> Trainbusting barrages
can be made in the barrage segment of
any phase allowing a player’s aircraft
to conduct missions. The markers are
removed in the next <strong>enemy</strong> Clean Up
Phase and their effects are continuous
until then.</p>
<h2 id="149-air-transport">14.9 Air Transport</h2>
<p>Air Transport allows the player to use his
Transports to move supplies and units
around the map.</p>
<p>Air Transport can occur in any friendly
Movement Segment.</p>
<p><strong>14.9a</strong> Transports have a printed trans-
port capacity. They can carry any load
up to that capacity. (See <a href="../4-0-general-concepts/#47-transportation-equivalents">4.7</a> 
for Transportation Equivalents.) 
Transports at
the same air base can combine their
transport capacity to carry cargo. For
instance, two aircraft with a capacity of
“1/2T” could carry a parachute battalion
that has a transport equivalence of 1T.</p>
<p><strong>14.9b</strong> Some Transports have a transport 
capacity of 1/2T. These units must
usually use rule <a href="#149-air-transport">14.9a</a>, combining to
move 1T amounts. Alternatively, they
can move 1T when making a double
capacity trip using <a href="#149-air-transport">14.9e</a>. <strong>In no case</strong>
can the 1/2T amount be saved for later
or be rounded up to 1T. (<strong>Exception:</strong>
cargo survival, <a href="#144-flak">14.4h</a>).</p>
<p><strong>14.9c Cargo Types.</strong> Supply Points can
be transported by air, as can combat
units that are in <strong>Move Mode</strong> with an
MA of <strong>10 or less Leg MP</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>14.9d</strong> Combat units can move up to 1/2
their MA during the phase it is carried
by Air Transport (per <a href="../4-0-general-concepts/#47-transportation-equivalents">4.7d</a>). 
This can be
done before or after the Air Transport
mission (or both) provided no more
than 1/2 MA is expended.</p>
<p>There are important mode and phasing
considerations. SP cannot be moved
before/after a mission due to “leapfrog”
restrictions. Combat units can change
to Move Mode prior to Air Transport
in Movement Phase, but are not able
to “flip” orientation during Reaction
or Exploitation. Combat units must be
released reserves to move (and possibly
attack) before/after a mission during
Reaction or Exploitation. All other units
being air transported in these phases
essentially have an MA of zero (and
cannot attack). Note that units moving
before/after the mission in Reaction have
their MA halved twice, for a total of
×1/4 MA.</p>
<p><strong>14.9e</strong> Air Transport missions are flown
to any friendly air base. Treating each
plane separately, the mission hex can&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A)</strong> &hellip;be at twice the plane’s range,
provided it is made Inactive at the
destination air base, or</li>
<li><strong>B)</strong> &hellip;be at the plane’s normal range,
in which case it returns to any air
base within normal range after the
mission (Note: It goes inactive), or</li>
<li><strong>C)</strong> &hellip;be at half the plane’s range, in
which case its transport capacity is
<strong>doubled</strong> and it returns to any air
base within half of its range after
the mission (Note: It goes inactive).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14.9f</strong> A given air base can only unload
2T times the base Level per Movement
Segment using Air Transport. However,
<strong>any</strong> amount of cargo can be unloaded
<strong>if</strong> the Transports in excess of this limit
become Inactive in the destination hex.</p>
<h2 id="1410-air-drop">14.10 Air Drop</h2>
<p>An Air Drop is a form of Air Trans-
port that does not require a friendly air
base at the destination. Air Drops also
differ in that sometimes they must be
planned in advance and the cargo may
be destroyed in the attempt. Air Drop
can be done either by parachute or glider
landings. The rules in Section <a href="#149-air-transport">14.9</a> apply
to Air Drops except where they differ
with the rules below.</p>
<p><strong>14.10a Unit Eligibility.</strong> Only SP and
combat units with the “Para” symbol
can Air Drop. (<strong>Exception:</strong> Any combat
unit that can be air transported can land
via glider, per <a href="#1410-air-drop">14.10e</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>14.10b Prior Planning.</strong> Air Drops of
<strong>combat units</strong> have special restrictions.
They can only be made in the Movement 
Phase and require a Drop Plan—a
written record of the hex where each
combat unit will be dropped and the
specific turn the mission will take place.
You must make this plan either before
the game begins <strong>or</strong> at least two turns
in advance of the scheduled drop. Plan
these drops in the Aircraft Refit Phase.
No unit can ever be on more than one
Drop Plan at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Units making planned air drops do
not require trace supply on the turn
they are dropped (<a href="../12-0-supply/#126-trace-supply">12.6h</a>).</li>
<li>Supply drops never need prior planning
nor do they have any phase
restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14.10c Cancellation and Delay.</strong> All
or part of a Drop Plan can be cancelled
or delayed. (Some units could drop as
scheduled, some be delayed, and some
cancelled.) Make this decision during
any Aircraft Refit Phase. If delayed, the
exact same drop is now pushed back
to the next turn. If cancelled, the plan
ceases to exist (and even if the same plan
is drawn up in the future, planning must
start from scratch).</p>
<p><strong>14.10d Air Drop Procedure.</strong> Resolve
Flak and then check for losses using
the Air Transport Success Table. Roll
two dice for each combat unit or 1T
of supply separately, based on the type
of terrain in the mission hex and drop
method (glider or paradrop). Apply the
table’s modifiers. If the roll is successful,
the unit is placed in the drop hex (and
its movement is finished for the phase).
Otherwise, it is destroyed. Also destroy
any cargo that attempts to land <strong>on</strong> an
enemy combat unit (but if the hex only
contains enemy non-combat units, apply
relevant parts of rule <a href="../9-0-ground-combat/#914-specialized-combats">9.14</a>.</p>
<p><strong>14.10e Gliders.</strong></p>
<p>

  </div></figure>
</p>
<p>Gliders increase the
capacity of Transport aircraft.
Gliders do not count against
mission and basing limits and
are always considered Active.
Gliders are generic “change” that can
combine and break down like SP.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A)</strong> It costs one Eq to build two Glider
Points (as if rebuilding aircraft).
Gliders cannot be built in games
where they are not provided. A
glider cannot be reused—place it
in the Dead Pile after use.</li>
<li><strong>B)</strong> Gliders can only move when they
are part of an Air Transport or Air
Drop mission. When an air base
is captured, gliders are destroyed.</li>
<li><strong>C)</strong> A full-strength Transport plane
(any capacity) can tow one Glider
Point. The capacity of a Transport/Glider 
combination is 2T (all
of which is loaded on the glider). A
Transport that doubles its capacity
(per <a href="#149-air-transport">14.9e</a>) can carry 4T if two
Glider Points are used, or alternatively 
it can carry 2T on one
Glider Point and carry its printed
capacity for a paradrop.</li>
<li><strong>D)</strong> In Air Transport missions, cargo
on gliders is not counted against
off-loading limits (<a href="../15-0-air-bases/">15.0b</a>).</li>
<li><strong>E)</strong> In Air Drop missions, cargo on
gliders has an increased chance
for success, as shown on the Air
Transport Success Table.</li>
<li><strong>F)</strong> Gliders do not check for Flak, but
their tow aircraft do. The capacity
of the Transport/Glider combination 
is reduced to 1T if the towing
aircraft takes a loss. Handle losses
to cargo per <a href="#144-flak">14.4g</a>.</li>
<li><strong>G)</strong> Gliders do not take part in Air
Combat. While being towed, a
loss is handled per <a href="#144-flak">14.4g</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14.10f Integral Gliders.</strong> As opposed
to the separate counter version above,
some games have Transport planes that
contain a glider component as part of
the counter itself. Basically, these are
special Transports with an improved
transport capacity because they <strong>always</strong>
tow gliders (which make them <strong>exempt</strong>
from base unloading limitations). Rule
<a href="#149-air-transport">14.9e</a> modifies their capacity by range.</p>
<p><em><strong>Specific Game Note:</strong> The CASE BLUE
transports with Integral Gliders can only
perform Air Transport and Base Transfer
missions (never Air Drop missions).</em></p>
<h2 id="1411-base-transfer">14.11 Base Transfer</h2>
<p>A Base Transfer is a simple way to move
an aircraft from one base to another
without performing any other functions.
Air units can <strong>double</strong> their range when
moving from base to base.
When a Fighter unit performs a Base
Transfer <strong>within</strong> normal range, it stays
Active. Otherwise, it goes Inactive (as
do all other plane types making Base
Transfers).</p>
<p><em><strong>Play Note:</strong> Players may find that aborting
after a mission is often a more useful way
to change base, since then the aircraft can
“do something” along the way.)</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Complex Aircraft Mission Example:</strong>
During his Movement Phase’s Barrage
Segment, the Allied player tries a Barrage
on an Axis stack with a Reserve marker
showing. The strike consists of a Blenheim
V bomber and two Hurricane II fighters.
The mission hex is inside the Patrol Zone.
The mission has a +2 Flak Mod operating
against it (+1 for a Patrol Zone (since a
Fighter is present), +1 for three mission
aircraft).</em></p>
<p><em>First, the Axis player resolves Flak against
the mission. He chooses to avoid literally
intercepting and forcing an actual Air
Combat. The Axis player rolls two dice
and gets a 10 which is modified to 12
resulting in a loss. The Allied player uses
the Mission Loss Table to randomly select
one of his aircraft to take the loss and it
is the Blenheim. It is reduced and the
mission continues.</em></p>
<p><em>The Allied player now totals the Barrage
Strength of the three mission aircraft. The
Fighters are worth a combined 6 Barrage
Points. The now reduced bomber adds 3
more, for a total of 9 points. The initial
Barrage Table column is 8-11. There is
no barrage supply cost since this is an Air
Barrage. No Allied combat unit is adjacent
to the target (no spotter: three columns left)
and it turns out there are 4 RE in the hex
(one shift right). No further column shifts
apply. The total Barrage Table shift is two
left, to the 3-4 column. The Allied player
rolls two dice and gets a 12, giving a 1/2
result. He then rolls a 5 with one die, so it
“rounds up.” The Axis player must remove
one step of his choice and the mode of the
stack is changed from Reserve to DG. The
Allied aircraft now return to any friendly
base within range.</em></p>
