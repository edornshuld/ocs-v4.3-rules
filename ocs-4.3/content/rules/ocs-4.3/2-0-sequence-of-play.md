## 2.1 The Game Turn

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/game-turn-2.1.png)

A Game Turn is a series of
events, the order of which is
called the Sequence of Play.
Each Game Turn consists of
two Player Turns, one for each player.
For reference, we call a player taking
action in his own turn the “phasing”
player; the one taking action during his
opponent’s turn is the “non-phasing”
player.
A Player Turn consists of the sequence
of steps listed below. Each step involves
one player or the other—either phasing
or non-phasing—taking action. At the
end of the second Player Turn, advance
the turn marker and begin the process
again. The sequence of play must be
strictly followed in the order given.

## 2.3 Narrative Sequence of Play

### Pre-Turn Phase

#### Weather Determination Segment
  
One player, it is irrelevant which, rolls
to determine the weather. The weather
affects the entire Game Turn.

#### First Player Determination Segment
  
Each player rolls two dice. The player
with the higher roll elects to be first
or second in the Game Turn. Re-roll
any ties.


### 1st Player, Player Turn

#### Aircraft Refit Phase

The phasing player refits his Inactive
air units. Pay 1T per base at which the
player desires to refit. At these bases,
the player can refit up to two aircraft
per base Level. An air base cannot refit
aircraft if in an un-negated enemy Zone
of Control (ZOC).

#### Reinforcement Phase

The phasing player places any new units
in their entry points according to the
Arrival Schedules. He rolls on his Supply
Table to determine the number of new
Supply Points available and places them
on the map. He rolls on his Variable
Reinforcement Table (sometimes called
the Repl Table) and places any resulting
reinforcements on the map. The phasing
player conducts Unit Rebuilds and/or
Unit Consolidations as desired.

#### Movement Phase

The phasing player may Breakout any
combat units not in trace supply. He
then moves his ships and ground units,
individually or in stacks, making any
voluntary mode changes as each unit
starts to move. Restrictions are imposed
by mode, supply, terrain, and enemy
units. As they move, combat units can
conduct overruns, a form of attack made
on the move. They can also destroy or
damage supply dumps and facilities, as
well as build or improve air bases and
hedgehogs. Units and supplies can move
by rail or sea transport. The phasing
player’s Active air units can perform
missions throughout the phase: Fighter
Sweep, Hip Shoot, and Air Transport/Drop 
during the movement segment;
Barrage in the barrage segment (which is
also when naval units execute barrages).

#### Supply Phase

The phasing player must replenish units
with Low or Exhausted internal stocks,
if possible. He then determines which
of his combat units are in trace supply.
Those out of trace must either expend
on-map supply or be marked Out of
Supply and be checked for attrition. 

#### Reaction Phase

The non-phasing player can move his
ships and aircraft and released Reserves.
He can destroy supply dumps, but no
other destruction or construction-type
activities are allowed. Released units can
move half their Movement Allowance
(or MA) and overrun. The non-phasing
player’s Active air units can perform
missions throughout the phase: Fighter
Sweep, Hip Shoot, and Air Transport
in the movement segment; Barrage in
the barrage segment (when ships and
artillery also execute their barrages). This
phase does not have a Combat Segment.

#### Combat Phase

The phasing player first resolves artillery
barrages. Then his combat units make
attacks, with restrictions imposed by
mode, supply, and terrain. A combat
result might cause retreat, advance, or
mode change.

#### Exploitation Phase

The phasing player can move and fight
with released Reserves (full MA) and
with units in Exploitation Mode (half
MA). He can destroy supply dumps, but
no other construction-type activity is
allowed. The phasing player’s Active air
units can perform missions throughout
the phase: Fighter Sweep, Hip Shoot,
and Air Transport in the movement
segment, and Barrage in the barrage
segment (when ships and artillery units
also execute their barrages). Finally there
is a Combat Segment, when eligible
combat units can attack.

#### Clean Up Phase

The phasing player removes all DG and
Exploitation markers from his units and
removes (or flips) all his Fuel markers.
Remove Trainbusting markers generated
by the non-Phasing Player.

### 2nd Player, Player Turn

Repeat the above steps for the second
player with the roles reversed.

### Turn End

Advance the Turn Record marker and
begin the above sequence again.


## 2.4 Simulcast Turns

Some games contain periods where the
major activity is logistical buildup on
both sides. These periods can run much
faster if both players declare the turn to
be a “simulcast” turn and follow these
rules:

1. Players execute the turn sequence at the same time.
2. No combat or barrage is allowed.
3. Neither player executes anything which could be construed as an offensive, raid, or any other such activity on land, water, or air. 

***Design Note:** The goal of the simulcast
turn is to speed up the down periods—
don’t screw up that goal by attempting to
gain some sort of advantage. If you have
some operations in mind, don’t agree to the
simulcast turn in the first place. However,
don’t waste time playing a regular turn for
minor reasons.*
