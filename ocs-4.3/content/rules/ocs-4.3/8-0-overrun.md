Overrun is a form of combat that occurs
during the various Movement Segments.
Only use these procedures against hexes
with enemy combat units—refer to [9.14](../9-0-ground-combat/#914-specialized-combats)
when moving into hexes containing only
non-combat units, ships, and/or planes.

**Procedure:**

Move the attacking stack adjacent to
the target hex and declare the overrun.
Overruns are made from the adjacent
hex; the attackers do not actually enter
the defender’s hex unless the defender
vacates it.

Resolve overruns like any other combat
(follow the sequence in [9.2](../9-0-ground-combat/#92-sequence-summary)). Note the
increased chance for Surprise ([9.8](../9-0-ground-combat/#98-surprise)) in
overruns. If the attacker does not retreat
and has sufficient MP remaining after
an overrun (regardless of whether the
defender retreats or is destroyed), he
can continue to move and can make
further overruns against the same or
other targets. If the defender retreats or
is destroyed, all of the attacking units
must enter the hex (at no additional
movement cost).

## 8.1 Overrun Restrictions

Only Attack-Capable units that started
the phase stacked together can overrun.
They must be in Combat, Move, or
Exploitation Mode. Units can overrun
as many times as their MA allows. There
is no limit on the number of times a
given defender can be overrun during
a single Movement Segment. Resolve
each overrun separately.

**8.1a** Moving units spend 3 MP for each
overrun. If the combat result allows the
attacker to occupy the defender’s hex,
there is no additional MP cost to do so.
Units with fewer than 3 MP remaining
cannot overrun.

***Example:** A unit does two overrun attacks
against a hex that would cost 1 MP to
enter. It is successful the second time, and
advances into the defender’s hex with 6
MP expended.*

**8.1b** Overruns are only allowed if the
MP cost to enter the hex (the combined
hex, hexside, and Trainbusting costs)
would be 3 MP *or less*. A terrain that
lists a cost of “All” cannot be overrun.

**8.1c** Units cannot use features such as
roads or bridges to bring the hex’s MP
cost down, to negate prohibited terrain,
or to meet the restriction of [6.1d](../6-0-ground-movement/#61-how-to-move-ground-units).

**8.1d** Each overrun is made against a
single adjacent enemy hex. A given hex
can be overrun several times in a single
phase. The same moving stack can make
several overruns (against the same or
different hexes).

**8.1e** No unit, regardless of the combat
result, **ever** gains an Exploitation marker
([9.13b](../9-0-ground-combat/#913-exploit-results)) when making an overrun.

**8.1f** Should the attacking units choose
to take one or more of their options as
retreats from an overrun, they end their
movement for the phase. The attackers
can continue movement if they do not
retreat.

**8.1g** Only units conducting the overrun
can move in an overrunning stack.

**8.1h** Other friendly units can be in the
hex from which an overrun is made.
These units affect stacking limits in that
hex ([4.8a](../4-0-general-concepts/#48-stacking)), but are not involved in the
overrun. The overrun’s combat result
has no effect on these units whatsoever
(regardless of what it is).
