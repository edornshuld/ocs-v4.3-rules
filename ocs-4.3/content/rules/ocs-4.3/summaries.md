## Landing Craft Summary

The three kinds of Landing Craft are
Landing Craft, DUKW, and LST. The
generic term “Landing Craft” applies to
all three types; some rules are specific to
only DUKW ([18.4e](../18-0-naval-power/#184-landing-craft)) or LST ([18.4f](../18-0-naval-power/#184-landing-craft)).

DUKW have a unique MA of 8 per
phase; the other two types of Landing
Craft are slow ships ([18.1f](../18-0-naval-power/#181-general-naval-rules)) that move
10 per phase.

**The Floating Forces/Sea Box** is where
Landing Craft will typically load cargo.
Landing Craft move to and from the
map via Naval Release Points (NRP) or
Air Entry Points (AEP). There is no cost
to make this move, but a Landing Craft
can only go one direction — into the
box or out of it — in any given phase.
* Loading in this box can only be done
in the Movement Phase, before the
Landing Craft starts to move.

**Cargo** can be ground units and SPs.
Loading is usually done in the Floating
Forces/Sea Box, but can also be done at
on-map ports. There is no cost to load or
unload cargo, but a Landing Craft stops
its movement after unloading. There are
three types of Amphibious Landings:
* **A)** If the hex is occupied by an enemy
combat unit, it is a Beach Assault
(see [18.6](../18-0-naval-power/#186-beach-assaults)). Very uncommon!
* **B)** When not using a friendly port,
an ALT Roll is needed to unload
cargo. This can only be done in the
Movement Phase. Make one roll
per 3 RE unloaded in a hex. Make
ALT rolls after all Landing Craft
have finished moving. A ground
unit can land in either Combat
or Move Mode, and can move 1/2
MA after landing. Exception: SP
and Transport Points cannot be
unloaded.
* **C)** When using a port, an ALT Roll
is not needed — just unload cargo
using the port’s capacity. This can
be done during the Movement,
Reaction, or Exploitation Phase.
A ground unit can land in either
Combat or Move Mode, but no
movement is allowed after landing.
Note that SP and Transport Points
can unload when using ports, and
that ports with a capacity above
zero can use their full capacity to
load/unload any one combat unit.

***Play Note:** Use regular Sea Cap to move
SP ashore during the Movement Phase.
Then use “extra” Landing Craft to bring in
SP at ports in Exploit and Reaction Phase.*

**DUKW** move 8 per phase when acting
as a ship, and can only carry “light”
cargo (the kind that can be moved via
Air Transport missions). They can be
converted to act as a truck when they
make an ALT roll (and this can be the
same roll that unloads cargo), and at
this point their MA is 24. They stop if
they unloaded cargo as part of this roll;
otherwise they multiply remaining MA
by 3 if converting from ship-to-truck
(and divide remaining MA by 3 when
converting the other direction).
* When in truck mode, a DUKW
spends 2 MP to load/unload.

*Example: A DUKW loaded with 1 SP
spends 3 MP moving from an NRP to
the coastal hex where it wants to convert
to a truck. An ALT roll is made, and if
successful the DUKW gets to make an
“after landing” move using a proportion
of remaining movement. Figure this by
multiplying remaining MA by 3, so in
this case 5 x 3 = 15 MP. It can thus move
a couple of hexes and then unload the SP.)*

* ALT roll is not needed to convert
from truck to ship!
* The main use of DUKW is bringing
SP ashore in non-port hexes!

**LST** have the unique ability to create
a new 1 SP port. This can be done by
making a successful ALT roll (and this
can be the one used to unload cargo).
These ports cannot be damaged (but are
destroyed when an enemy combat unit
overruns the hex). LST are downgraded
to regular Landing Craft when a loss is
taken, so keep them in Floating Forces
until you want to create an LST Port —
they are too valuable to risk!
* An LST port cannot be put in the
same hex with another port!

## Miscellaneous

**Transport Equivalents ([4.7](../14-0-air-power/#147-barrage--hip-shoots)).** Generally,
RE size is the transportation cost. But
if a unit’s printed MA in **Move Mode**
is from **1 to 6 Leg MP**, inclusive, its
transportation cost is halved.

**Moving & Transport ([4.7d](../14-0-air-power/#147-barrage--hip-shoots)) .** In these
cases only, half MA can be spent...
* **before** when using rail cap ([13.3e](../13-0-specialized-units/#133-railroads)).
* **before and/or after** when using Air
Transport ([14.9d](../14-0-air-power/#149-air-transport)).
* **after** an ALT landing ([18.5h](../18-0-naval-power/#185-amphibious-landings)) that
requires a roll (but never in cases
where no ALT roll is made).

**Stacking Order ([4.8](../4-0-general-concepts/#48-stacking)).** The enemy can
always see top F-type, hedgehog, and
combat unit with a ZOC. Put a single
mode and/or OOS marker on top of
all such units in a stack; put Loss/Low/
Exhausted markers under each unit.

**Enemy Non-Combat Units ([9.14](../9-0-ground-combat/#914-specialized-combats)).** See
also the Capture Table.

**Blowing Dumps ([12.11](../12-0-supply/#1211-destruction-and-capture)).** This can only
be done during a friendly Movement,
Reaction, or Exploitation Phase.

**Loading and Unloading ([13.2f](../13-0-specialized-units/#132-transport-points)).** It
costs 10% of Transport’s MA to load
or unload. Loading can be done in any
hex. Transport points can only unload in
hexes which contain a friendly combat
unit, port, air base, and/or an existing
unloaded supply dump.

**Engineer-Capable ([13.8a](../13-0-specialized-units/#138-engineer-functions)).** An HQ or
Engineer in Combat Mode, or else in
DG Mode and oriented toward Combat
Mode (per 5.10e).

**Refit Air Base ([15.1](../15-0-air-bases/#151-refitting-aircraft)).** Inactive aircraft
refit at rate of two units per Air Base
Level. Cost is 1T per base.

**Air Base Construction ([15.3](../15-0-air-bases/#153-building-air-bases)).** To build
or improve one Level costs 1 SP.

**Hedgehog Construction ([16.0b](../16-0-hedgehogs)).** To
build or improve one Level costs 2 SP.

**Port Repair ([19.0d](../19-0-ports-and-shipping)).** To repair one Hit
costs 1 SP.

## Shipping Summary

### Sea Cap

**Capacity.** In some games, each side has
a shipping capacity given in the scenario
rules. Modifiy RE size of cargo per the
Equivalents rule ([4.7](../4-0-general-concepts/#47-transportation-equivalents)).

**Path.** A naval movement path ([18.1c](../18-0-naval-power))
is needed between the two ports. The
capacity of each port limits what can
be shipped in and out in a single phase.
**Exception:** A port with a capacity above
zero ([19.0a](../19-0-ports-and-shipping)) can use its full capacity
to load/unload any single ground unit.
Note an unnegated EZOC reduces a
port’s capacity to zero.

**Phasing.** Shipping is done during the
Movement Phase only. Paths are checked
at the instant the shipping takes place.
There is no movement allowed before or
after being shipped, and combat units
must be in Move Mode.

### Rail Cap

**Capacity.** Each side has a Rail Cap per
scenario rules. Modifiy RE size of cargo
per the Equivalents rule ([4.7](../4-0-general-concepts/#47-transportation-equivalents)).

**Rail Connections.** Rail transport begins
and ends in detrainable hexes ([13.3c](../13-0-specialized-units/#133-railroads)).
Rails blocked by enemy combat units or
ZOCs (or of the wrong gauge) cannot
be used for Rail Cap movement.

**Phasing.** Rail Transport is during the
Movement Phase only. Combat units
can move up to half their MA before
entraining, and must be in Move Mode.
No movement is allowed afterward.

**RR Repair ([13.3g](../13-0-specialized-units/#133-railroads)).** These units can
entrain/detrain in **any** rail hex, can do
so in Combat Mode, and can move after
a rail move. They can convert the gauge
of up to four hexes per turn during the
Movement Phase only.

### Air Transport

**Capacity.** Short range doubles a Tpt’s
capacity ([14.9e](../14-0-air-power/#149-air-transport)). Modifiy RE size of
cargo per the Equivalents rule ([4.7](../4-0-general-concepts/#47-transportation-equivalents)).
Unlike other forms of shipping…
* Cargo limited to SP and units with
Move Mode ≤ 10 Leg MPs ([14.9c](../14-0-air-power/#149-air-transport)).
* Enemy ZOC have no effect.

**Air Base Limits.** An Air Base can only
unload 2T times its Level per phase.
**Exception**: If the Transport planes go
Inactive at the destination base, the usual
unloading limits can be ignored.

**Phasing.** Air Transport missions can
be flown during a player’s Movement,
Exploitation, and Reaction Phases. To
be eligible, a combat unit must be in
Move Mode (note orientation cannot
be changed before the mission during
Reaction or Exploitation). A total of 1/2
movement is allowed before and/or after
a ground unit is transported ([14.9d](../14-0-air-power/#149-air-transport)).

## Supply Summary

Mostly it is just a player’s Combat units
that need supply. Air units only need
supply for Refit ([15.1](../15-0-air-bases/#151-refitting-aircraft)). Non-combat
units and ships never need supply.

**Combat Supply ([9.5](../9-0-ground-combat/#95-supply-and-combat)).** Pay supply to
attack or defend:
* Attacker pays 1T per attacking step
(except DAK 2-step brigades only
1T). Units which do not have full
combat supply cannot attack.
* Defender pays 2T per combat (but if
1 RE or less, cost is 1T). Defenders
always have the option to withhold
combat supply and defend at x1/2.

**Internal Stocks. ([12.10](../12-0-supply/#1210-internal-stocks)).** Usable only
if normal combat supply is unavailable.
Low (or Exhausted) units must pay 2T
(or 4T) to remove these markers in the
soonest possible Supply Phase.

**Barrage Supply ([10.1b](../10-0-barrage)).** For artillery
barrages only (not naval or air), pay cost
given near the top of the appropriate
table (using the initial column, before
shifts). Internal stocks cannot be used.

**Draw ([12.3a](../12-0-supply/#123-on-map-supply)).** Always traced 5 Truck
MPs back to the needed supplies.

**Throw ([12.3b](../12-0-supply/#123-on-map-supply)).** HQs use Draw to gain
supply and then use Throw to send it
where needed. Distance is MPs equal
to the HQ’s Throw Range. Use mobility
type indicated on HQ (usually Truck).

**Supply Paths ([12.3d](../12-0-supply/#123-on-map-supply)):** Pay the normal
terrain costs when tracing a draw or
throw path (but never apply weather
effects that increase this cost). A path can
be through enemy ships or non-combat
units, but not combat units. EZOCs
block paths (but can be negated).

**Adjacent is Close Enough ([12.3c](../12-0-supply/#123-on-map-supply)).** A
supply path only needs to reach a hex
adjacent to the supplies for Draw, and
only needs to reach a hex adjacent to the
destination for Throw.

**Fuel Supply ([12.5](../12-0-supply/#125-fuel-supply)).** Required to move
combat units with Truck or Track MPs.
(Advance after combat and retreat do
not need fuel.) Three options ([12.5c](../12-0-supply/#125-fuel-supply)):
* Pay 1T to move one counter, or
* Pay 1 SP to fuel a Formation marker
until next friendly Clean-Up Phase.
* Pay 1 SP to place a fuel marker on an
HQ. All independent units within
that HQ’s throw range are fueled
until next friendly Clean-Up Phase.

**Trace Supply ([12.6](../12-0-supply/#126-trace-supply)).** Draw can be to a
Supply Source, a detrainable hex, or an
Extender connected to a Supply Source.
EZOCs shut down a Supply Source (but
can be negated).

**Eating Off The Map ([12.6c](../12-0-supply/#126-trace-supply)).** When
Trace Supply is not available, pay 1T per
2 RE to keep combat units in supply.
(Exception: Strat Mode units cannot
“eat off map.”)

**Trace Supply Effects.** Supplied units
have normal values. A unit marked Out
of Supply (OOS) is checked for Attrition
([12.8b](../12-0-supply/#128-attrition--out-of-supply)) and suffers the following effects:
* With Combat Supply, an OOS unit
attacks and defends at 1/2 strength.
* Without Combat Supply, an OOS
unit cannot attack and defends at
1/4 strength.
* OOS units have no ZOC.
* Barrage, AR, and Movement values
are unaffected.
