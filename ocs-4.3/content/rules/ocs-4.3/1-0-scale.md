OCS games can include combat units
from company to division in size. The
ground scale is usually 5 miles per
hex, but can drop as low as 2.5 miles
per hex (based on theater, operational
density, and so on). A game turn usually
represents a half-week of time, but can
drop as low as 1/4 week (given 2.5 miles
per hex ground scale).
