# About
***

Learning OCS is tough (for me). There are a lot of rules. I created this web-friendly version of the rulebook for my own personal use. 
I find the hyperlinked references to other rules/sections on a device-friendly, responsive website
to be very helpful and minimizes having to flip through pages in the rulebook constantly.  I hope The Gamers will implement something like this in the future!
That said, the authors (Mr. Dean Essig and company) have produced an incredibly well-written and technically concise rulebook. 

I have modified this online version of the rulebook to suit my own needs 

* **Example:** I have dramatically added to the Sequence of Play ([2.0](2-0-sequence-of-play)). 
Steps include hyperlinks to relevant sections and color helps me visualize where combat can occur 
by the phasing (red) or non-phasing (blue) players. I tried to design the sequence in such a way 
that it is my "homescreen" or "main hub" for rules when I sit down and play. Combining hyperlinks and 
the "back button", I can easily navigate to important rule sections and back quickly and easily.*

# Introduction
***

Operational Combat Series (OCS)
games simulate campaign-level combat
from 1900 to the mid-1950s. The series
goal is to allow a sophisticated study
of historical events while maintaining
mechanical simplicity.

<br>

# Version 4.3 Rules
***

The v4.3 rulebook is a minor revision.
Some rules have been clarified and errata
has been corrected. Small changes are
marked with a √. Note the chart booklet
was given a complete makeover, but is
functionally the same as the previous
versions (so feel free to continue using
them). Enjoy!

Note that some terms were changed in
the move from v3 to v4. Strategic Move
Mode was shortened to Strat Mode,
Combined Arms Effects was replaced by
the more descriptive Anti-Tank Effects,
and the old Railroad Interdiction and
Interdiction effects were combined into
the new Trainbusting mission. Keep
these changes in mind when playing
older games in the series.

# Game Components
***

## The Game Map

The map depicts the area in which the
campaign was fought. Laminate the map
or cover it with 1/8” Plexiglas to help
protect your gaming investment. 

### The Hex Numbering System. 
Each hex is identified by a unique four-digit
number in the form **“column.row.”** If
a game has more than one map, a letter
identifies each, and the hex numbers for
hexes on a given map are prefixed with
the map’s letter. So “B10.10” identifies
hex 10.10 on Map B. The digits before
the decimal point identify the hex row,
reading along the horizontal dimension
from left to right. The digits after the
decimal identify the exact hex in that
particular row, reading along the vertical
dimension from bottom to top. Only
every fifth hex has a printed number
(xx.05, xx.10, xx.15) to create grid lines.
For example, to find hex 29.17, follow
the grid line for xx.15 until you find
the 29.xx hexrow, then count up two
hexes to 29.17.

### Map Edge Hexes. 
A hex is playable
only if at least half of the hex is showing.

### Off Map Movement. 
Unless it is
specifically allowed in a game, units can
neither exit the map to re-enter later
nor conduct any off-map movement.
Destroy units forced off the map.

### Turn Record. 
A turn record track is
printed on the map or play aids. Each
box represents one game turn. (See [2.1](2-0-sequence-of-play/#21-the-game-turn))

### Weather Record. 
Mark the current
weather on this track. 

### Holding Boxes. 

There are two types
of holding boxes, those corresponding
to a specific hex and those showing an
abstract off-map location.
* Specific-hex holding boxes are used
to relieve congestion on the map.
The units are considered still in the
hex associated with the box.
* Off-map holding boxes can hold an
unlimited number of units. Gamespecific rules will restrict these boxes
to one side or the other, and describe
how units move between them and
the map. No combat is allowed. 

## The Counters

Carefully cut or punch the cardboard
counters from the sheets and keep them
organized (baggies work nicely) by side,
type, and identification. This will make
setup easier. The various kinds of units
and markers are described in [3.0](3-0-units-and-markers/).

## The Rules

An OCS game contains both Series rules
and Game rules. The Series booklet has
the rules that apply to all OCS games.
The Game booklet includes special rules,
scenarios, and set-up information for the
specific game.

### Organization

Rules are numbered
by section and case. Each major rules
grouping is a section; each paragraph
within a section is a case. The number
6.2 would, for example, refer to section
6, case 2. A specific case may contain a
number of statements that are lettered,
as in 6.2a and 6.2b.

### Repetition

Repetition. Once stated, a rule is
repeated in another section only when
needed for clarification in that section. 

## Set Up Notes

In the Game rules is set-up information
for the scenarios. Unless amended by
special instructions in that booklet, the
following are always true:

* **A)** “w/i X” means to set up a given
unit or stack at or within X hexes
of the location given. A stack can
“spread out” into multiple hexes
within this radius (and possibly
deploy breakdown regiments).

* **B)** Ground units can be set up in any
desired mode. (Exception: ground
units adjacent to enemy AttackCapable units cannot be set up in
Reserve or Strat Mode.)

* **C)** Transport Points that are stacked
with Supply Points (SP) can set
up loaded or unloaded. Transport
Points that are not stacked with SP
always set up unloaded (unless the
scenario rules specify otherwise).

* **D)** Organic Trucks start “full” only if
a scenario explicitly states that they
do. (But they can take advantage
of **C** above if they set up stacked
with SP).

* **E)** Aircraft always begin Active.

* **F)** Units cannot set up over-stacked.

* **G)** Units generally begin the game at
full strength.

* **H)** When the notation “(inclusive)”
follows set-up boundaries, those
units can set up anywhere within
the zone including the boundary
lines.

* **I)** Units can never set up in a hex that
they could not enter using regular
movement.

* **J)** Units, Formation markers, and
HQs always set up “unfueled.”

* **K)** Use index cards to create off-map
areas for each side’s Dead Pile and
to organize reinforcements.
