Ports are printed on the map with an
anchor symbol and capacity. Ports are
non-combat units, so it takes an Attack-
Capable enemy unit to enter these hexes.
See [9.14h](../9-0-ground-combat/#914-specialized-combats) for port capture.

**19.0a Capacity.** Port capacity is the
maximum number of SP allowed to
load and/or unload in a single phase. For
example, a port with a 1T capacity could
load **or** unload 1T in a phase, but not
both. Units and supplies coming into
the port without an ALT roll via [18.5g](../18-0-naval-power/#185-amphibious-landings)
count against the capacity of a port, as
does normal shipping ([19.0f](../19-0-ports-and-shipping/)).

Ports with a capacity above zero **can**
choose to use their **full** capacity to load
or unload a **single** combat unit whose
Transport Equivalent size exceeds the
port’s current capacity. This can be the
only loading/unloading performed at
the port during the phase.

A port is “shut down” when in an enemy
ZOC. Per [4.5a](../4-0-general-concepts/#45-zone-of-control), negation is possible for
trace supply operations, but not for Sea
Cap. Ports which are shut down have
their capacity treated as zero. The port
instantly recovers its normal capacity
when the enemy is driven away (or for
trace supply only, the ZOC is negated).

***Play Note:** A port continues to function
when enemy combat units or ZOC block
the hexes that lie between it and the sea
(unless this is overridden by a game-specific
rule).*

**19.0b Damage.** Ports can accumulate
“hits” when attacked by the Barrage
vs. Facility Table. These hits affect the
port’s capacity as noted near the table
(round to nearest Token of capacity).
Whether damaged by the Barrage vs.
Facility Table or Voluntary Reduction
(below), a port can never accumulate
more than 4 hits. Some ports have a
Damage Track specific to them on the
map; for these apply the Port Capacities
listed and not the generic hit effects.

**19.0c Voluntary Reduction.** During
the Movement Phase (only), at least 1
RE of combat units that are in Combat
Mode and do not move can inflict 1 hit
on a port in that hex. Engineers can also
perform the work, per [13.8d](../13-0-specialized-units/#138-engineer-functions). No more
than 1 hit per turn can be inflicted in
this way.

**19.0d Repair.** Ports can be repaired
in the Movement Phase (only) using
construction ([13.8d](../13-0-specialized-units/#138-engineer-functions)). Each Engineer-
Capable unit can repair one hit at a cost
of 1 SP. Only one hit per port can be
repaired in a given turn.

**19.0e Ports and Trace Supply.** The
game-specific rules will specify which
ports, if any, are supply sources. A port
that is available to the player as a supply
source loses that ability if the port falls
below a 1 SP capacity.

**19.0f Shipping.** Game-specific rules
define each side’s Shipping Allowance
(if any), which is sometimes called Sea
Cap. Naval units are not used for this
abstracted form of transport, used to
move ground units from port to port.
* **A)** Shipped units must be in Move
Mode.
* **B)** Sea Cap can only be used during
the Movement Phase.
* **C)** No movement is allowed before
or after a unit is shipped.
* **D)** Any combination of SP, combat
units, and Transport Points can
be shipped. The limitations of each
port’s capacity must be observed.
* **E)** Each point of shipping allowance
can move 1 SP of cargo (see [4.7](../4-0-general-concepts/#47-transportation-equivalents)
for Transportation Equivalents).
* **F)** Enemy ZOC prevent use of Sea
Cap ([4.5a](../4-0-general-concepts/#45-zone-of-control)) at a port.
