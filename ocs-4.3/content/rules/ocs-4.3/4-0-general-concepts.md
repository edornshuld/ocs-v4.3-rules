***

The terms used to describe classes of
units have **precise meanings** that are
important to understanding these rules.
For instance, “ground units” describes
a broader range of units than “combat
units” (which are a subset of ground
units), and “Attack-Capable units” are
a further subdivision of combat units.
Use of the word “units” by itself (not
modified as in “independent units” or
“DG Mode units”) refers collectively to
all units—ground, naval, and air—when
a narrower context is not obvious.

## 4.1 Rounding Rule

Players will often be required to round
decimals to whole numbers. When the
fractional part is less than .5, round
down. When the fractional part is .5 or
more, round up.

## 4.2 Fractions

Round the final odds in combat, but
do not round fractional strengths prior
to determining odds. Fractional barrage
factors are combined and then rounded
to determine the barrage column. **Never**
round fractional Movement Allowances.

***Design Note:** Players should take note of
the important effect of this rounding rule
on odds calculation. In this series, a 15 to
6 attack rounds to 3:1.*

***Example:** Three units attack with modified combat strengths of 2.5, 3.25, and
4 (for a total strength of 9.75) against
the defender’s strength of 2. Combat odds
would be figured as 4.875 to 1, which is
rounded to 5:1.*

## 4.3 Cumulative Effects

In all cases where a value is subject to
multiple modifiers, the effects are cumulative. For instance, quarter the strength
of a combat unit halved for terrain and
halved for supply. 

## 4.4 Attack-Capable Units

Combat units with **printed** Combat
Strengths are Attack-Capable, **unless** the
strength is parenthesized or the unit is in
Strat Mode or Reserve Mode. A printed
Combat Strength of zero still makes a
unit Attack-Capable ([9.14a](../9-0-ground-combat/#914-specialized-combats)).

**4.4a** Attacking units (in both combat
and overrun) must be Attack-Capable.

**4.4b** Attack-Capable units in Combat
Mode and not currently marked Out of
Supply have a Zone of Control ([4.5](#45-zone-of-control)).

**4.4c** Ground movement into a hex with
an enemy non-combat unit (a port, air 
base, supply dump, Transport Point, or
hedgehog) requires an Attack-Capable
unit. This may result in destruction or
capture, per [9.14](../9-0-ground-combat/#914-specialized-combats).

***Player Note:** Attack-Capable units are no
longer required for movement into “empty”
enemy villages or cities.*

## 4.5 Zone of Control

Attack-Capable units in Combat Mode
have a Zone of Control (ZOC) unless
currently marked Out of Supply. Units
in other modes **do not** have a ZOC.
(**Exception**: Exploitation Mode, [5.9c](../5-0-modes/#59-exploitation-mode).)
A unit’s ZOC limits enemy actions in
the six hexes adjacent to the unit. This
is true regardless of the terrain in those
hexes or the hexsides between them.

**4.5a** The following actions **cannot** be
taken in an enemy ZOC. An action
marked \<Negation\>, however, is allowed
if the ZOC has been negated (4.5b);
negation is not possible for the others.

* **A) Truck Movement. \<Negation\>**
A unit with **Truck MP** (mobility
types are explained in [3.1a](../3-0-units-and-markers/#31-ground-units) that
**enters** an enemy ZOC must either
end its movement or else conduct
an overrun. One overrun might
lead to another, thus allowing the
unit to continue through more
than one ZOC. Note that units
**starting** a phase in an enemy ZOC
can exit that hex using Truck MP,
and that movement using Leg or
Track MP is unaffected by ZOCs.
* **B) Supply Lines. \<Negation\>** An
enemy ZOC blocks all kinds of
supply paths (e.g., draw, throw,
Extenders) traced with **Truck MP**
in or out of a hex. Note an HQ
or Extender with Leg or Track
mobility is unaffected by ZOCs.
* **C) Rail Transport - Literal.** Units
using Rail Cap.
* **D) Rail Transport - Trace Supply \<Negation\>**
* **E) Rail Conversion operations.**
* **F) Port Operations - Trace Supply. \<Negation\>** ***Specific Game Note:** In either edition of DAK, units **do not** negate EZOCs for Port Operations (F).*
* **G) Port Operations-Literal,** Using Sea Cap.
* **H) Aircraft Refit. \<Negation\>**
* **I) Reserve Mode.** Units cannot enter Reserve Mode in an enemy ZOC ([5.7c](../5-0-modes/#57-reserve-mode)). Once in Reserve Mode, they can enter/exit ZOC normally.
* **J) Strat Mode.** Units cannot change to Strat Mode in an enemy ZOC ([5.8a](../5-0-modes/#58-strat-mode)), nor can they ever enter a ZOC while in Strat Mode.
* **K) Repl Rebuilds.**

**4.5b Negating ZOC.** Per 4.5a, some
ZOC effects can be negated. An enemy
ZOC in a hex is negated if that hex
contains a friendly combat unit at that
moment and, further, the unit doing
the negating **will not spend MP later
in the current phase.** (It is allowed to
leave the hex via actions such as advance
after combat or Breakout, which do not
require expenditure of MP.) The friendly
combat unit doing the negation need
not have a ZOC itself. Note that when a
unit **starts** the phase in an enemy ZOC,
negation is not needed to exit that hex.

***Example:** Aircraft refit can still be done
even if a Combat Mode enemy unit is
adjacent to the base, provided a friendly
combat unit (of any mode) is in the hex.*

**4.5c ZOCs and Retreats.** See [9.12e](../9-0-ground-combat/#912-retreats--advances).

***Design Note:** The lack of ZOC effects
on Leg and Track movement can cause
anomalous events until a player masters the
implications of this feature. Players need to
think carefully about unit placement, both
along the front lines and in the rear area!*

## 4.6 Regimental Equivalents

The concept of Regimental Equivalents
(RE) is used to figure the size of a unit
(important for things like stacking and
transport). Only ground combat units
have RE sizes, as only they need them.

* Multi-step units have their RE size
shown on the counter.
* Battalions are 1/2 RE.
* Repl units and company-sized units
are 1/4 RE.
* All other sizes count as 1 RE. (There
may be game-specific exceptions.)

A multi-step unit’s RE size is reduced by
one for each step loss ([9.11](../9-0-ground-combat/#911-step-losses)). All other
combat units are 1 step for loss purposes,
regardless of RE size. (Some games have
exceptions to this rule.)

***Design Note:** The RE concept has its roots
in the GDW Europa games.*

## 4.7 Transportation Equivalents

Combat units, Transport Points, and
SP can be transported by rail ([13.3](../13-0-specialized-units/#133-railroads)),
air ([14.9](../14-0-air-power/#149-air-transport)), Landing Craft ([18.4](../18-0-naval-power/#184-landing-craft)), and
abstract shipping ([19.0f](../19-0-ports-and-shipping/)). A Transport
Point ([13.2](../13-0-specialized-units/#132-transport-points)) can **only** carry SP.

**4.7a** RE and SP are interchangeable
transportation equivalents. One point
of rail capacity can move either 1 SP or
1 RE (or a combination, such as 2T of
supply and 1/2 RE of units).

**4.7b** If a unit’s printed MA in **Move
Mode** is from **1 to 6 Leg MP**, inclusive,
its transportation equivalent is halved.
For all other units, the transportation
cost is the same as the RE size.

**4.7c** Transport Points can load (and
carry) a number of SP equal to their
point value. Transport Points can be
carried by landing craft, rail, or shipping
(but not by air). Count only the size
of the Transport Points when figuring
the transportation equivalent—whether
loaded with SP or not, it always takes
1 point of capacity to ship 1 Transport
Point.

**4.7d** Movement and Transport. A unit
cannot be moved by more than one type
of transport in a phase—for instance, a 
unit is not allowed to move by rail to
an airbase, and then immediately use air
transport. Furthermore, ground units
cannot spend any movement points in
the phase they make Air Drops ([14.10](../14-0-air-power/#1410-air-drop))
or Beach Assaults ([18.6](../18-0-naval-popwer/#186-beach-assaults)), or when they
move by Shipping ([19.0f](../19-0-ports-and-shipping)). Sometimes,
however, **half MA** can be spent by units
being transported:
* **before** when using rail cap ([13.3c](../13-0-specialized-units/#133-railroads)).
* **before and/or after** when using Air
Transport ([14.9d](../14-0-air-power/#149-air-transport)).
* **after** an ALT landing ([18.5h](../18-0-naval-popwer/#185-amphibious-landings)) that
requires a roll (but never in cases
where no ALT roll is made).

## 4.8 Stacking

Stacking is having more than one unit
in a hex. **The maximum number of
combat units allowed to stack in a
hex is 10 RE.** Any number of SP or
Transport Points can stack together in a
hex, but never more than one port, one
air base, and one hedgehog. Stacking in
Off-Map Holding Boxes is unlimited.
Air and naval stacking is described in
[14.2a](../14-0-air-power/#142-aircraft-movement) and [18.1b](../18-0-naval-popwer/#181-general-naval-rules). There is no movement
cost for stacking or unstacking.
Usually only one side’s units can be
in a given hex, but on rare occasions
friendly and enemy units are allowed
to stack together (see [4.8c](../4-0-general-concepts/#48-stacking)). Nationality
differences among friendly units has no
effect on stacking (unless game-specific
rules contain restrictions).

**4.8a** Overstacking is having more than
10 RE of combat units in a given hex at
the end of **any** segment or phase. There
is one exception: stacking is not enforced
in the Reinforcement Phase (see [13.6](../13-0-specialized-units/#136-reinforcements)).
The owning player is required to reduce
any overstacked hexes by eliminating the
units of his choice.
Units can temporarily overstack during
movement except when conducting an
overrun, when the overrunning units
and any other friendly units in the hex
cannot exceed the 10 RE limit.

**4.8b Order of Stacking.** The player can
to a certain degree arrange his stacks in
any order that makes sense to him, but
there are some requirements related to
fog of war and ease of play.

* **A)** Mode and Out of Supply markers
should **always** be placed on **top** of
all such units in the hex. Except
where another such marker comes
between them, the markers imply
that **all** units beneath them in the
stack are in that mode (or Out of
Supply). Some units can never be
in a certain mode or status, and
those units simply ignore any such
marker above them in the stack.
For example, SP and Inactive air
units under a DG marker are not
in Disorganized Mode.
* **B)** Put Low, Exhausted, or Step Loss
markers **beneath** each and every
affected unit.
* **C)** If a unit with a ZOC is in a hex,
it should be the top combat unit
(to make ZOCs obvious).
* **D)** An HQ can be the top combat
unit in the hex when no enemy
ground units are adjacent (to help
the owning player see his logistical
net). The enemy player must be
told if the hex has a ZOC.
* **E)** Active planes are put on top of any
ground units, but on request the
enemy player can also see the top
combat unit and any hedgehog. If
an Active fighter is in the stack, it
should be the top air unit (to make
Patrol Zones obvious).
* **F)** If a hedgehog is present, it should
be the top ground unit (to make
Hogs obvious). Again, the enemy
player can see the top combat unit
on request.

**4.8c Enemy Stacks.** Friendly units can
move or retreat into hexes with enemy
units in the following cases **only**. There
is no extra MP cost. If an unlisted type
of enemy unit is in the hex, friendly
units **cannot** enter.
* **A)** Attack-Capable units can enter
hexes with enemy ships, planes,
and non-combat units. Resolve
the Specialized Combat per [9.14](../9-0-ground-combat/#914-specialized-combats).
* **B)** Ships can enter hexes with enemy
non-combat units and air units.
(They coexist.)
* **C)** Planes conducting a mission can
enter hexes containing all kinds of
enemy units
* **D)** Rail transport and supply paths
can be traced through enemy noncombat units, planes, and ships
(but cargo cannot detrain in these
hexes).

**Reminder:** Non-combat units are SP,
Transport Points, hedgehogs, air bases,
and ports. See [3.3](../3-0-units-and-markers/#33-non-combat-units).

## 4.9 Fog of War

**4.9a** A player can never look through
an enemy stack. However, the enemy
player may always see the **hedgehog,
top Combat Mode Attack-Capable
unit** (or top combat unit if none have
a ZOC), **and top Active plane** in any
hex. While the player will know if the
top unit is Strat Mode, DG, or Out of
Supply, he is not entitled to know about
internal stocks status or steps lost.

**4.9b** During combat (both regular and
overrun), both players must reveal their
Action Rating, AT Effects ([9.4e](../9-0-ground-combat/#94-terrain-and-unit-strength)), and
total Combat Strength. Neither side
is required to show actual units (other
than per [4.9a](#49-fog-of-war)).

**4.9c** During a barrage, the barraging
player should reveal his total Barrage
Strength, and be informed of all relevant
table shifts or Flak Points.

**4.9d** During Air Combat, both players
should reveal all aircraft present and
which are involved in each round.

**4.9e** Players normally make die rolls
in the open, after stating their purpose
(such as “this is my Variable Repl roll”).
If players agree, they can make certain
rolls in secret to increase the fog of war.
