## 5.1 Units Affected by Mode

Ground units use the modes described
in this section. Not all ground units can
use all six modes; SP, ports, air bases, air
units, and hedgehogs do not use any
modes at all.
Ships make limited use of Disorganized
Mode ([18.1d](../18-0-naval-power/#181-general-naval-rules)). 

## 5.2 General Mode Restrictions

**A unit affected by mode can only be
in one mode at any given time.**

Ground units without a mode marker
are in either Combat or Move Mode,
depending on the side of the counter
showing. Markers are placed on **top** of
a unit to show the other four modes:
Reserve, Strat, Disorganized (DG), and
Exploitation. When a mode marker is
removed, a unit returns to Combat or
Move Mode (depending on its existing
orientation).

Units will move and fight according to
the values on the side of the counter
that is showing (either Move Mode or
Combat Mode). Some modes modify
these values. A unit with a mode marker
uses the base values of Combat or Move
Mode (it is said to be “oriented toward”
the mode whose side is showing), but
is only in the mode indicated by the
marker. This means, for example, that
a unit in DG Mode could never move
by rail, which requires Move Mode,
regardless of its counter orientation.
Units of differing modes can stack, and
one unit’s mode has no effect on the
mode of other units in the stack.

***Design Note:** The implications of these
various modes with respect to the turn
sequence and each other will be apparent
only after repeated play. Suffice it to say
they are many and subtle. Good players
will orchestrate the differences between
these modes to their advantage.*

## 5.3 Voluntary vs. Involuntary

**Voluntary Modes** are Combat, Move,
Strat, and Reserve. **Involuntary Modes**
are DG and Exploitation.

## 5.4 Mode Change

Units in Combat, Move, Reserve, and
Strat Mode can change to a different
voluntary mode in the Movement Phase.
This is done as each individual unit or
stack begins to move. For example, a
unit in Combat Mode could be changed
to Reserve Mode (with either the Move
or Combat side up). 

Reserve Mode units can be “released”
during the Reaction and Exploitation
Phases (see [5.7b](#57-reserve-mode)). No other voluntary
mode changes are allowed outside of
the Movement Phase.

Mode change does not cost MP.

Involuntary modes are not chosen, they
just “happen” as a result of combat,
retreat, and barrage. The involuntary
mode **replaces** the existing mode. An
involuntary mode marker can only be
removed during the player’s Clean Up
Phase. Note that during the Movement
Phase a unit in DG Mode can change
its orientation between the Combat and
Move sides of the counter.

**5.4a Marker Limits.** The game-specific
rules place strict limits on the number of
Reserve markers available to each side.
To conserve these valuable markers, a
player can show the entire portion of a
stack that is in Reserve Mode with one
marker ([4.8b](../4-0-general-concepts/#48-stacking)), and the marker need not
be placed until **after** units have finished
moving their 25%. There are no limits
on using the other mode markers, but
players should still conserve markers to
keep stacks manageable. (They should
**not** attempt to deceive their opponent
by piling in extra, unneeded markers!)

## 5.5 Combat Mode

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/combat-mode-5.5.png)

Combat Mode is the side of
the counter with the greater
strength and lesser movement
values. These units anticipate
contact with the enemy.

**5.5a** Combat Mode units are unable
to use rail, air, and shipping transport.
(**Exception:** Rail Repair units, [13.3g](../13-0-specialized-units/#133-railroads).)

**5.5b** Units must be in Combat Mode
to convert railroad gauge ([13.3f](../13-0-specialized-units/#133-railroads)) and
perform Engineering functions ([13.8a](../13-0-specialized-units/#138-engineer-functions)).

**5.5c** Repl units and Transport Points
cannot enter Combat Mode.

**5.5d** Units must be in Combat or Move
Mode when landing via the Amphibious
Landing Table (see [18.5c](../18-0-naval-power/#185-amphibious-landings)).

**5.5e** A unit must be in Combat Mode
to exert a ZOC per [4.5](../4-0-general-concepts/#45-zone-of-control). (**Exception:**
Exploitation Mode, [5.9c](../5-0-modes/#59-exploitation-mode).)

## 5.6 Move Mode

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/move-mode-5.6.png)

Move Mode is the side of the
counter with lesser strength
and greater movement. These
units sacrifice some combat
capability to enhance speed.

**5.6a** Move Mode is required for rail, air,
and shipping transport. (**Exception:** Rail
Repair units, [13.3g](../13-0-specialized-units/#133-railroads).)

**5.6b** Repl units and Transport Points
have no Combat Mode side to their
counters, so they are always oriented
toward Move Mode.

**5.6c** Units must be in Move or Combat
Mode when landing via the Amphibious
Landing Table (see [18.5c](../18-0-naval-popwer/#185-amphibious-landings)).

## 5.7 Reserve Mode

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/reserve-mode-5.7.png)

Units in Reserve Mode can
react quickly to events. Mark
them with a Reserve marker.
Reserve Mode units **cannot**
attack, overrun, or barrage until released.
**The pool of Reserve Mode markers is
limited, per [5.4a](#54-mode-change).**

Units attacked while in Reserve Mode
**defend at half Combat Strength.** Units
in Reserve Mode can **move 1/4 MA**
during the regular Movement Phase.
They can also move when “released”
per 5.7b.

**Play Note:* The 25% movement allowed
for Reserves during the Movement Phase
can be useful for shifting units in bad
terrain (per [6.1c](../6-0-ground-movement/#61-how-to-move-ground-units) they can ‘always move
one hex’) such as in Mountains or Jungle,
and also to squeeze an additional 25%
movement out of key units.*

**5.7a** Orientation. A unit that enters
Reserve Mode can be flipped to have
either side of its counter facing up. This
orientation (toward Combat Mode or
Move Mode) cannot be changed until
the player’s next Movement Phase.

**5.7b** Releasing Reserves. Reserve Mode
units that are “released” by a player can
be used during his Reaction Phase or
Exploitation Phase. To release a unit,
simply remove the Reserve marker: the
unit is now in Combat or Move Mode,
depending on its orientation ([5.7a](#57-reserve-mode)). 
A player can release a unit and have it
move and overrun before deciding to
release other Reserves.

* **A) Exploitation Phase.** The released
reserves have their full movement,
barrage, and combat capabilities.
They are able to attack or barragewith other released Reserves or
Exploitation Mode units in the
subsequent Combat Segment, and
can overrun.
* **B) Reaction Phase.** Released reserves
move with half their MA, but have
full combat values in overruns.
Regular combat is not allowed in
the Reaction Phase, but released
artillery can barrage in the Barrage
Segment.

**5.7c Enemy ZOC.** A unit cannot switch
into Reserve Mode when in an enemy
ZOC. Units already **in** Reserve Mode
can enter/exit ZOC normally.

**5.7d Enemy Contact.** Remove Reserve
markers from stacks that receive any
kind of result (even an **ignored** Do1)
when defending in overrun or regular
combat. The units are now in Combat
or Move Mode, as determined by their
orientation ([5.7a](#57-reserve-mode))).

**5.7e** Reserve Mode units **cannot** use
rail, air, and shipping transport.

**5.7f** Transport Points are not allowed
to enter Reserve Mode. (**Exception:**
Organic Trucks can do so.)

**5.7g** No unit in Reserve Mode can be
stacked with a hedgehog at the end of
any Movement Segment.

## 5.8 Strat Mode

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/strat-mode-5.8.png)

Strat Mode units don’t expect
any contact with the enemy.
Mark this mode with a Strat
marker. **Units in Strat Mode
must be oriented to their Move Mode
sides.**

The advantage of Strat Mode is that
units **move using twice their MA.** The
mode does **not** confine them to road
movement—they may freely leave the
road net.

Strat Mode has several disadvantages: a
unit **cannot** attack, overrun, or barrage,
and its Combat Strength and Action
Rating are both reduced to ZERO.

**5.8a Enemy ZOC.** Units cannot enter
Strat Mode when in an enemy ZOC.
Units in Strat Mode cannot move or
retreat into an enemy ZOC. If forced to
do so (in a retreat), they are eliminated.
(If an enemy unit moves next to them,
nothing special occurs.)

**5.8b Supply.** Units in Strat Mode can
never “eat off the map” and must end
their movement in hexes where trace
supply is currently possible. An HQ in
Strat Mode cannot throw supplies.

**5.8c** Transport Points cannot enter Strat
Mode.

**5.8d** Strat Mode units **cannot** use rail,
air, and shipping transport.

## 5.9 Exploitation Mode

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/exploit-mode-5.9.png)

This is an involuntary mode
awarded to attacking units
that achieve great success on
the Combat Table. Mark the
mode with an Exploit marker (keep the
existing orientation toward Move or
Combat). Exploitation Mode units (and
Released Reserves) can move and fight
during the Exploitation Phase ([11.0](../11-0-exploitation-phase/)).

Exploitation Mode units **move using
half their MA.** Combat and Barrage
Ratings are normal.

Remove all Exploit markers during the
Clean Up Phase. The units are now in
Combat or Move Mode, depending on
their existing orientation.

**5.9a** Restrictions on gaining an Exploit
marker are found in [9.13b](../9-0-ground-combat/#913-exploit-results).

**5.9b** Exploit markers have numbers to
remind players of the minimum Action
Rating (2, 3, or 4) needed for a unit
in the stack to take advantage of the
involuntary mode change.

**5.9c** Units retain any ZOC they had
before gaining the Exploit marker.

## 5.10 Disorganized Mode (DG)

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/dg-mode-5.10.png)

This involuntary mode is an
adverse result of a combat,
retreat, or barrage. Mark this
mode with a DG marker and
keep the existing unit orientation toward
Move or Combat. Remove any other
mode markers from the stack.
Remove DG markers from phasing units
during the Clean Up Phase. The units
are now in Combat or Move Mode,
depending on their existing orientation.

**5.10a Entering DG Mode.** Combat
units enter DG Mode when any of the
following happens:
* **A)** They suffer a DG result in barrage
or combat.
* **B)** They retreat two or more hexes
(apply a DG result the instant the
unit retreats into its second hex).
* **C)** They retreat into an enemy ZOC.
If units that are **already** in DG
Mode retreat into an enemy ZOC,
inflict one step loss on those units.
The owning player decides which
unit takes the loss.

At the moment ***any*** of the DG triggers
occurs, all combat units in the hex—
even those not otherwise involved in a
retreat—change to DG Mode. Note a
unit that is already DG suffers no further
effect, except as noted in “C” above.

**5.10b Effects of DG.** DG Mode units
suffer the following effects:
* **A)** They halve their combat, barrage,
and movement values.
* **B)** They subtract 1 from their Action
Ratings. (**Exception**: the original/
unmodified Action Rating is used
on the Attrition Table.)
* **C)** They are unable to overrun or earn
Exploitation Mode.

**5.10c** Transport Points are exempt from
DG results and are never in that mode.
(An Organic Truck in Reserve Mode
does, however, lose its mode marker
when the hex receives a DG result.)

**5.10d** DG Mode units **cannot** use rail,
air, and shipping transport.

**5.10e Engineering and Rebuilding.**
Rail Repair units ([13.3g](../13-0-specialized-units/#133-railroads)) and Engineer-
Capable units ([13.8a](../13-0-specialized-units/#138-engineer-functions)) are still able to
perform their special functions when
DG, assuming they are oriented toward
Combat Mode. This also applies to the
road-building and bridging units found
in some games, and to HQs rebuilding
units ([13.5a](../13-0-specialized-units/#135-replacement-units)), but not to non-engineer
units building hedgehogs.
