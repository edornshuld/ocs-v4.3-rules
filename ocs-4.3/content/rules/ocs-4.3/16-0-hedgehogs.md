Hedgehogs (called “Hogs”)
represent field works, wire,
mines, and other obstacles
that help protect a hex from
combat and barrage attacks. Hedgehogs
cannot move and never require supply.
Hedgehogs are non-combat units, so
enemy units can only enter these hexes
if they are Attack-Capable. See [9.14e](../9-0-ground-combat/#914-specialized-combats)
regarding hedgehog capture.

**16.0a** Hedgehogs come in four levels
of increasing quality. No hedgehog can
ever exceed Level-4.

**16.0b Construction.** Hedgehogs can
be built or improved only during the
Movement Phase. One RE of units, that
are in Combat Mode and do not move,
can build/improve a Level of hedgehog
in their hex. Alternately, an Engineer-
Capable unit can do the work ([13.8d](../13-0-specialized-units/#138-engineer-functions)).
The cost is 2 SP.
* A hex can only have its Hedgehog
Level **increase** by one per turn (such
as from none to Level-1). It thus
takes four turns and 8 SP to build a
Level-4 Hedgehog.

**16.0c Reduction.** Hedgehogs can be
reduced during the Movement Phase
only. One RE of units, that must be
in Combat Mode and not move, can
reduce a hedgehog by one Level. An
Engineer-Capable unit can also do the
work ([13.8d](../13-0-specialized-units/#138-engineer-functions)). There is no SP cost.
* A hex can only have its Hedgehog
Level **decrease** by one per turn (such
as from Level-3 to Level-2).
* Remove a hedgehog reduced below
Level-1.

**16.0d Combat Effects.** A hedgehog
aids defensive combat with a die roll
modifier equal to its Level (so a Level-3
Hedgehog gives a -3 DRM). A defender’s 
hedgehog also affects Surprise with a
-1 DRM (this does not change by Level).

**16.0e AT Effects.** Hedgehogs provide
Heavy AT ([9.4e](../9-0-ground-combat/#94-terrain-and-unit-strength)) to combat units in
the hex.

**16.0f** Reserve Mode units cannot end a
phase in a Hedgehog ([5.7g](../5-0-modes/#57-reserve-mode)).

**16.0g** There can never be more than one
hedgehog in a hex.

**16.0h** Combat and barrage results never
reduce or eliminate a hedgehog.
