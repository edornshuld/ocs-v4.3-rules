Breakdowns are generic units
that are detached from multi
-step units, typically infantry
divisions. They allow these
divisions, which cannot otherwise split
up, to occupy more ground. Breakdowns
are 1 RE units with either a “Brkdwn”
identification or none at all. They are
not usually limited to the counter mix
(if players don’t mind making extras).

A multi-step unit creates a Breakdown
in its hex by detaching one of its steps.
Use a Step Loss marker to record this
(it is essentially just like a combat loss).
Note a unit’s last step can **never** become
a Breakdown.

**Multi-step units that are “Armor” or
“Mech” ([3.2a](../3-0-units-and-markers/#32-combat-units)) are not able to create
or absorb Breakdowns. Only “Other”
type units may do so.**

**20.0a** Multi-step units can create one or
more Breakdowns when they begin to
move or to advance/retreat after combat.
These are the **only** times Breakdowns
can be created.

**20.0b** A multi-step unit can only create
a Breakdown with an AR equal to or
less than its own, and may only **absorb**
a Breakdown with an AR greater than
or equal to its own.

**20.0c** When being created or absorbed,
the multi-step unit must have the same
“marker & mode” status (such as Low
Ammo or DG) as the Breakdown.

**20.0d** Reduced multi-step units **must**
absorb eligible Breakdowns (within the
restrictions of [20.0b](../20-0-breakdowns/) and [20.0c](../20-0-breakdowns/)) they are
stacked with at the end of any phase.
This is the only time when Breakdowns
are absorbed.

**20.0e** There is no MP cost to create or
absorb a Breakdown, and a Breakdown
can move in the phase it is created or
absorbed.

**20.0f** Breakdowns are 1 RE and have
one step. They are independent units.

**20.0g** Generally, all multi-step units of
the same nationality use the same pool
of Brkdwn counters (the unit type need
not exactly match). Note that there are
some game-specific exceptions to this.

***Specific Game Note:** The German pool of
infantry-symbol Breakdowns in CASE BLUE
and GBII are created and absorbed by all
of that nation’s multi-step infantry, jaeger,
mountain, SS, and LW divisions. Their
security divisions can neither create nor
absorb breakdowns. Axis allies— Italians,
Romanians, and Hungarians—have their
own Breakdown pools, and can neither
create nor absorb the German Breakdowns.*
