The Reaction Phase is a chance for the
non-phasing player to disrupt enemy
plans with movement, overruns, and
barrages. (There is no Combat Segment.)

**7.0a** The only ground units that can be
used in this phase are the non-phasing
player’s released Reserve Mode ([5.7b](../5-0-modes/#57-reserve-mode))
units. (**Exception**: Ground units can
use Air Transport, per [14.9d](../14-0-air-power/#149-air-transport).) He can
release as many or as few reserves as he
wants—see [5.7b](../5-0-modes/#57-reserve-mode) for complete details.
Released artillery can conduct barrages
in the phase’s Barrage Segment.

**7.0b** Handle barrages and overruns in
the Reaction Phase normally.

**7.0c** The non-phasing player’s ships and
Active aircraft are all eligible to be used
in this phase.
