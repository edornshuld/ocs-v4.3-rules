These House Rules are **not** offered as a
set of “super-advanced, most-realistic”
rules, so don’t feel like you have to dive
into the deep end! At the very least,
some might enhance solo study, and as
such are worth including. As with the
optionals, each rule has a letter grade to
show its popularity.

## HR-1. Initiative Rolls ([2.3](../2-0-sequence-of-play/#23-narrative-sequence-of-play)) - C
The player who went first the previous
turn wins tied rolls.

*Commentary: This adds an interesting
new wrinkle to the decision-making.*

## HR-2. Increased FOW ([4.9](../4-0-general-concepts/#49-fog-of-war)) - B
Allow peeking under the top unit in
an enemy stack (to see what is under a
marker or air unit) only if an Attack-Capable 
unit is adjacent to the hex.

*Comment: This is more like v3.0 rules.*

## HR-3. Decreased FOW ([4.9](../4-0-general-concepts/#49-fog-of-war)) - B
For ease of play, spread out aircraft to
one side of the base, Active planes faced
one way and Inactive planes the other.

*Commentary: This style was often used
at Homercon. It violates the spirit of
limited intel, but is more playable.*

## HR-4. Reserves & Hogs ([5.7g](../5-0-modes/#57-reserve-mode)) - B
Let Reserves operate out of hedgehogs.

*Commentary: The restriction bothers
some people, and this also gets rid of a
fiddly exception.*

## HR-5. Tiger Tanks ([9.4e](../9-0-ground-combat/#94-terrain-and-unit-strength)) - B
Tiger tanks get special treatment:
* Attacking Tigers never have a “x2”
terrain multiplier reduced by enemy
AT Effects ([9.4e](../9-0-ground-combat/#94-terrain-and-unit-strength)).
* Defending Tigers reduce an enemy
terrain multiplier of “x2” down to
“x1” (better than usual “x1.5”).
* Moving Tigers become DG at the
end of any segment in which they
spend more than 1/2 MA.

*Commentary: This is a fun little rule. I
wish I’d thought of it!*

## HR-6. Effects of Losses ([9.11d](../9-0-ground-combat/#911-step-losses)) - C
A 4-step division down to its last step
is x1/4 attacking and x1/2 defending.

*Commentary: It bothers a fair number
of players that a 4-step division has the
same strength whether at -2 or -3 losses.
This fixes that.*

## HR-7. Artillery Factors ([10.1](../10-0-barrage/#101-artillery-barrages)) - A
Allow an artillery unit to fire less than
its full barrage factors (to save on cost).

*Commentary: Many players want the
option to fire cheaper barrages. This
might scratch that itch.*

## HR-8. Barrage Losses ([10.0](../10-0-barrage)) - B
Roll a die to randomize which step is
lost.

*Commentary: This can get awkward
from a playability standpoint. But some
gamers play this way, and for them it
seems more realistic.*

## HR-9. Aircraft Barrages ([10.2](../10-0-barrage/#102-air-barrages)) - C
Only allow three planes to be subject to
flak and to actually drop bombs (there
can still be a fourth plane in the mission,
serving as a fighter escort).

*Commentary: Barrages were made more
effective in v4, so this is a big change but
not off the charts. It has a playability
advantage: flak loss easier to randomize.*

## HR-10. Minimal Fueling ([12.5c](../12-0-supply/#125-fuel-supply)) - C
An HQ or Formation is fueled for 2T
(not 1 SP) if units multiply their MA
by x1/4. Furthermore, the fuel marker is
removed at the end of the phase.
*Commentary: Gives the option to shuffle
a sector using minimal fuel costs.*

## HR-11. Air Combat ([14.3e](../14-0-air-power/#143-air-combat)) - C
For aircraft engaged in air combat over
a **friendly** air base, the loss roll is a 6
(not a 5-6).

*Commentary: This restores some of the
old air combat advantage of defending
over an air base.*

## HR-12. Late-War Flak ([14.4e](../14-0-air-power/#144-flak)) - A
Starting in June ‘43, change the Flak to:
* On a ‘9’ or more, a random plane is
aborted before resolving the mission.
* On an ’11’ or more, that plane also
takes a loss.
* On a ‘13’ or more, a 2nd plane is
randomly selected to abort before
the mission is completed.
Also, a combat unit with a flak symbol
is now +1 Flak.

*Commentary: Mostly just the return of
the old abort result. Makes a Flak roll
more likely to do something significant.*

## HR-13. Hip Shoots ([14.7](../14-0-air-power/#147-barrage--hip-shoots)) - new
The mission size is no longer limited to
a single unit, but there is a new phasing
limit of only one hip shoot per segment
against any given hex.

*Commentary: This speeds resolution and
makes the hip shoot less magical.*

## HR-14. Refit ([15.1](../15-0-air-bases/#151-refitting-aircraft)) - C
Halve the refit rate at an air base in Very
Close or Extremely Close terrain.

*Commentary: This discourages players
building bases in mountains, etc. If a
scenario setup has an air base in this
sort of terrain, allow it to displace to an
adjacent hex before play begins.*

## HR-15. Air Strips ([15.2](../15-0-air-bases/#152-air-strips)) - new
A hex with an Engineer-Capable HQ
has a temporary Air Strip. These cannot
be upgraded. When the HQ moves, air
units still at the Air Strip must follow
the Air Base Capture ([9.14f](../#914-specialized-combats)) procedure.

*Commentary: Roland wants, Roland
gets! Seriously, this seems like a good
way to let players establish Patrol Zones.*

## HR-16. ALT Landings ([18.5](../18-0-naval-power/#185-amphibious-landings)) - B
On a Failure or Mixed result, landed
combat units change to DG Mode.

*Commentary: Very minimal impact.*

## HR-17. SP Arty ([21.10](../21-0-optional-rules/#2110-supply-caches---new)) - new
Artillery with a Track MA can barrage
during Reaction and Exploitation even
if not in Reserve Mode.

*Commentary: This makes self-propelled
arty a blessing rather than just a fuel-chugging curse!*
