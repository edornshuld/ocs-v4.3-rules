***

During this phase, units can exploit a
breakthrough or finish off a battered
defensive position.

**11.0a** The only ground units that can
move or fight are Exploitation Mode
units and units released from Reserve
Mode. (**Exception:** Ground units can
use Air Transport per [14.9d](../14-0-air-power/#149-air-transport).) The phase
consists of a Movement Segment (which
allows overruns), a Barrage Segment,
and a Combat Segment.

**11.0b** The phasing player can release any
Reserves during this phase ([5.7b](../5-0-modes/#57-reserve-mode)). He is
not required to do so and can wait to see
how things are proceeding in the phase
before releasing additional Reserves. To
keep things straight, players can mark
released Reserves with Exploit markers.
Units actually in Exploitation Mode
move only **half** their MA and released
Reserves move their **full** MA.

**11.0c** Handle combat (regular, overrun,
or barrage) in the Exploitation Phase
normally.

**11.0d8** The phasing playerâ€™s ships and
Active aircraft are all eligible to be used
in this phase.

***Play Note:** Having Reserves that can be
released in the Exploitation Phase is often
the critical factor determining the success
or failure of an operation.*
