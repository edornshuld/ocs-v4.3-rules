The terms used to describe classes of
units have **precise meanings** that are
important to understanding these rules.
For instance, “ground units” describes
a broader range of units than “combat
units” (which are a subset of ground
units), and “Attack-Capable units” are
a further subdivision of combat units.
Use of the word “units” by itself (not
modified as in “independent units” or
“DG Mode units”) refers collectively to
all units—ground, naval, and air—when
a narrower context is not obvious.


## 3.1 Ground Units

Ground units are divided into a pair
of large sub-categories: combat units
([3.2](#32-combat-units)) and non-combat units ([3.3](#33-non-combat-units)). Each
has some or all of the following printed
on the counter: unit designation; size
and type symbols; Combat, Barrage,
Action Rating, and Movement values;
and supply-throw or barrage ranges. 

**3.1a Mobility Types.** Color indicates a
ground unit’s mobility type: Leg, Truck,
or Tracked. This can be different from
one side of the counter to the other.
Note that if the Movement Allowance
(MA) is in an outline font, use the color
inside the outline.

* **Leg** units have a White MA.
* **Truck** units have a **Black MA**.
* **Tracked** units have a <span style="color: red;">Red MA</span> in a <span style="color: Gold;">Yellow box</span>.

**3.1b** A type symbol has one “wheel” for
semi-motorized; two “wheels” for fullymotorized. This notation is for historical
interest only.

**3.1c** A Multi-Unit Formation ([13.7](../13-0-specialized-units/#137-formation-markers)) is
a group of ground units with the same
higher-level designation (such as “1st
Armor Division” or “6th Tank Corps”).
Colored stripes mark these formations
in newer games.

**3.1d** Some ground units have a <span style="color: Gold;">yellow dot</span> behind their Action Rating. These
cannot be rebuilt ([13.5c](../13-0-specialized-units/#135-replacement-units)).


## 3.2 Combat Units

Combat units are any ground units with
a Combat Strength. Each side of the
counter shows the unit in a different
mode (see [5.0](../5-0-modes/)). Note that HQs ([13.1c](../13-0-specialized-units/#131-hq-unitsa-id311a))
and artillery ([13.4b](../13-0-specialized-units/#134-artillery-units)) are combat units,
even though their Combat Strengths are
not printed on the counter.

**3.2a Combat Categories.** Color inside
the unit symbol rectangle indicates a
ground unit’s Combat Category (see
[9.4e](../9-0-ground-combat/#94-terrain-and-unit-strength)):

*	**Armor** has a <span style="color: Gold;">yellow</span> background.
*	**Mech** has a <span style="color: red;">red</span> background.
*	**Other** has **any color other than** red or yellow. 

***Design Note:** A unit with an armor unit
symbol can have a red background. Such
a unit has a tank force with an infantry
component. Other such combinations are
possible. The combination of color and
symbol depict the functional as well as the
nominal organization of a unit.*

**3.2b** A unit with a combat value in
parenthesis is **not** Attack-Capable (see
[4.4](../4-0-general-concepts/#44-attack-capable-units)). It can only defend.

**3.2c** The Action Rating grades a unit’s
leadership, training, equipment, and
cohesion. Printed values range from 0
to 5, with higher numbers being better.
(Some modes reduce these ratings, so a
-1 AR is possible.)

**3.2d** Multi-step combat units (usually
infantry divisions) have a Regimental
Equivalent (RE) number printed on
the counter. This RE value is used for
a number of purposes (such as stacking
and transportation) and is in a colored
dot for easy identification. Step losses
reduce the strength and size ([9.11d](../9-0-ground-combat/#911-step-losses)) of
these units.

**3.2e** Specialized units covered by the
series rules are listed below (individual
games may add other types):
* HQ units ([13.1](../13-0-specialized-units/#131-hq-unitsa-id311a))
* Rail Repair units ([13.3g](../13-0-specialized-units/#133-railroads))
* Artillery units ([13.4](../13-0-specialized-units/#134-artillery-units))
* Replacement units ([13.5](../13-0-specialized-units/#135-replacement-units))
* Engineer units ([13.8](../13-0-specialized-units/#138-engineer-functions))
* Breakdown units ([20.0](../20-0-breakdowns/))
	 
**3.2f Independent Units.**  Any unit that
is neither part of a multi-unit formation
([3.1c](#31-ground-units)) nor a multi-step unit ([3.2d](#32-combat-units)) is
“independent.” This is important mostly
for Fuel Supply ([12.5e](../12-0-supply/#125-fuel-supply)).


## 3.3 Non-Combat Units

Non-combat units come in five types:
ports, air bases, hedgehogs, Transport
Points, and Supply Points (SP). These
are ground units, but not combat units.
They have no Combat Strength and
cannot be used to absorb step losses. An
Organic Truck has the same Transport
Points value on both front and back of
the counter; other non-combat units flip
to show a different number of generic
“points” or “levels.”

**3.3a Supply Points (SP)** are supplies in
a specific location. A single SP roughly
equates to 1,500 tons of consumable
supply (an ideal mix of fuel, ammo, and
stores is assumed). An SP can be divided
into four smaller amounts called Tokens 
(T); each token is 1/4 SP. The SP and
Ts can break down and recombine as
needed. SP have no inherent movement
ability. They can be moved via the side’s
abstract rail/sea capacity and by units
with a transport capability: Transport
Points, certain ship types, and certain
aircraft types. The term for SP in a hex,
whether loaded on a Transport Point
or unloaded on the ground, is **supply
dump**. SP are “generic” units and can be
captured (and recaptured) when control
of a hex changes.

**3.3b Transport Points** have a point
value that shows both their size and how
many SP they can carry. (Thus a 1-point
truck’s full load is 1 SP.) Transport Points
can represent just about any kind of
vehicle or animal pressed into service
(from trucks to elephants). Transport
Points with a unit ID on their counter
are “Organic Trucks” that belong to a
specific multi-unit formation. 

**3.3c Ports, Air Bases, and Hedgehogs**
of various sizes can begin the game in
place or be constructed. These cannot
be moved. Ports can be damaged, which
reduces their capacity until repaired. Air
Bases can be reduced to a smaller size.
Hedgehogs can be reduced in level by
friendly (not enemy) action. References
to “air bases” in these rules generally
include air strips and aircraft carriers
as well; references to “ports” include
printed ports and converted LSTs.

**Important Note:** Ports and hedgehogs
are often printed on the map. A noncombat unit is considered to be in each
such hex.


## 3.4 Ships

Naval units—also called ships or by
their specific type, such as ‘Cruiser’ or
‘Destroyer’—can represent one or many
vessels, depending on type. Most naval
units are marked with Barrage Strength,
Range, Flak, and Protection Values. The
front of most naval counters represents
the full-strength ship, while the back is
the same ship but at reduced strength
due to damage. Landing Craft ([18.4](../18-0-naval-power/#184-landing-craft)) are
different: they are presented as generic
“points” of capacity capable of delivering
cargo (combat units, Transport Points,
and SP) to coastal hexes and ports.

***Design Note:** Individual ships (such as
carriers) are named and will be “slow” on
their damaged side. Naval units without a
“slow” side represent multiple ships: generally two Cruisers or four Destroyers. Each
“point” of Landing Craft represents many
small craft (usually “slow”).*


## 3.5 Aircraft

Air units—called aircraft or planes or
by their specific type (such as Fighter
or Transport)—represent roughly 20
to 45 aircraft. These are marked with
an Aircraft Silhouette, Aircraft Type,
Air Combat Rating, Barrage Strength,
and Range. Some aircraft also have a
Transport Capacity. The front of the
counter represents a full-strength unit;
the back is the same unit but at reduced
strength. 


## 3.6 Game Markers

**3.6a Supply Markers.** These indicate
supply states such as Out of Supply,
Low or Exhausted internal stocks, and
Fuel status.

**3.6b Mode Markers.** These designate
Reserve, Disorganized, Exploitation, and
Strat Mode.

**3.6c Weather Markers.** These show
the current weather, flight, and ground
conditions.

**3.6d Turn and Phase Markers.** These
keep track of the game turn and phase.

**3.6e Step Loss Markers.** These show
the losses to multi-step units.

**3.6f Formation Markers.** Use these
to represent a group of counters kept
off-map. This reduces on-map counter
density and can add to fog of war ([13.7](../13-0-specialized-units/#137-formation-markers)).
