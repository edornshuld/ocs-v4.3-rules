You can use these or not, depending on
what you want out of your game. Be
warned that some might alter balance
slightly, and take note that in general
the options tend to be used sparingly.
We have rated them with a letter grade
to show their overall popularity.

## 21.1 Recon - D

This option is for those who want to
incorporate some of the special attributes
of recon units. For this option, a “recon
unit” is any unit (regiment or smaller)
with a recon, motorcycle, armored car,
cavalry, or commando symbol.

During any phase in which it moves, a
recon unit can spend 1/4 its printed MA
and 1T to recon an adjacent hex. The
other player must then reveal the total
number of steps and whether Heavy or
Light AT is present (as in [9.4e](../9-0-ground-combat/#94-terrain-and-unit-strength)).

## 21.2 Proportional Loss - A

Adjust strength proportionally when a
multi-step unit has taken losses, rather
than [9.11d](../9-0-ground-combat/#911-step-losses). The formula is (Strength x
Current Steps / Printed Steps). Round
these strengths immediately.

***Example:** An 11-strength division with
two of three steps has a new strength of 7.*

## 21.3 Independents - D

In any attack by independent units that
does not also include an attacking divi-
sional unit, double the attacker’s supply
cost (to 2T per step). Furthermore, inde-
pendent units **cannot** use internal stocks
when attacking.

Attacks that combine independent units
with divisional units must use a divi-
sional unit for the Action Rating. This
does not apply to defense.

## 21.4 Long Range Air - B

Apply the following to aircraft moving
**more than 1/2** their printed range:
* **A)** Air Combat Rating is reduced by
one.
* **B)** Barrages suffer an additional shift
of one column left. This applies
regardless of the number of aircraft
in the barrage that are affected.
* **C)** Fighters that do a Base Transfer
must become Inactive (a change
to [14.11](../14-0-air-power/#1411-base-transfer)).

## 21.5 Re-Basing Limits - C

Allow only one unit per base Level per
turn to apply the Base Transfer mission’s
“Fighters can remain Active” clause,
or to enter as Active reinforcements at
a given base. Count an Air Strip as a
Level-1 Air Base for this rule.

## 21.6 Convention Tempo - D

This rule makes for an ahistorical high
rate of operations. It can be used in any
scenario and any of the games to make
a more intense gaming experience. In a
multi-player convention setting it keeps
everyone active, and it can also help new
players (who have not optimized their
play) adjust to the system’s demands.

**21.6a** Double all at-start, on-map SP,
excluding Organic Trucks that might
be loaded.

**21.6b** Double the rail capacity, and all
Transport Points at start.

**21.6c** Increase reinforcement supply
amounts and all shipping capacities by
50%.

**21.6d** Players get to roll twice on their
Variable Replacement Tables during
every Reinforcement Phase.

## 21.7 Revised Rebuilds - B
There are several changes to [13.5](../13-0-specialized-units/#135-replacement-units):
* **Limited Hoarding.** Repls some-
times represent remnants of elim-
inated units that have been reor-
ganized and returned to action. As
such, at least 1/2 of Pax and 1/2 of
Eq must be used on the turn they
are received. (So no saving them for
later unless at least two are received
on a given turn.)
* **Easier Rebuilds.** Reinforcing Repls
can arrive in the hex with any HQ
that is in trace supply (not “eating
off map,” etc.). There is no longer a
need to march or rail them forward.
* **One-Repl Rebuilds.** All steps can
now be replaced with either 1x Pax
or 1x Eq, regardless of previous cost.
(But “no rebuild” units still cannot
return from the dead, nor can units
that don’t have a rebuild cost.) For
instance, it now costs just 1x Pax
regardless of whether the old cost
was 1x, 2x, or 3x Pax. If the game’s
Rebuild Table shows a mix of Eq
and Pax being required, the cost is
now 1x Pax **except** in the case of
units with Track MP (on either side
of the counter), in which case the
cost is now 1x Eq.

## 21.8 Attacking Empties - B

Some players are puzzled as to why a
unit could move 100% of its MA and
attack an enemy unit to move at least
one hex further, while another unit can’t
attack the empty hex to do the same
thing. This option also helps sooth guys
who are disturbed by being penalized for
having a “too successful” preparatory
barrage (and not getting to attack at all).

**21.8a** Any unit otherwise able to attack
in a Combat Segment can do so, even
if no enemy units are in the target hex.

**21.8b** Do not assign the empty hex
a zero Combat Strength. Instead, the
attacker pays his attack SP normally
for all units involved and the units paid
for can advance into the target hex. No
Combat Table roll is needed and no
exploit result is possible.

**21.8c** Air-dropped combat units can
“attack empties” on the turn they land
at no supply cost. (Our thanks to Dick
Horneffer for this suggestion to give the
paras some post-landing movement.)

## 21.9 Reactive Artillery - C

By popular demand, a test rule from
v4.0 that did not make the final cut...

**21.9a** Allow artillery that is in Combat
or Move Mode to fire in the player’s
Reaction Phase even when not marked
in Reserve.

**21.9b** This rule does not allow the artillery 
to move in Reaction, or do anything
beyond the normal rules in Exploitation.

**21.9c** Artillery in Hedgehogs **can** take
advantage of this rule.

**21.9d** Ric Van Dyke cannot use this
rule.

## 21.10 Supply Caches - new

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/supply-cache-21.10.png)

The Supply Cache is a new
type of marker that players
hold off-map until “spent”
at any friendly HQ as **either**
Forage or Shells. The markers address
the perceived tilt in mechanics favoring
airpower at the expense of the big guns,
and also serve an “anti-raider” role.

**21.10a Shells.** A player can spend a
Supply Cache marker to pay the cost of
an artillery barrage being thrown supply
by an HQ. Shells are available even if
the HQ is not in trace supply.
* Shells pay 2T of an arty barrage’s
cost per marker spent. No “change”
is given if the cost is reduced below
zero.
* Shells also allow artillery units to
fire partial factors. For instance, a
26-1-1 could barrage with just ten
points — essentially a free barrage
after the marker’s cost reduction.

**21.10b Forage.** In the Supply Phase, a
player can spend a Supply Cache marker
to allow an HQ to provide all combat
units within its Throw Range with trace
supply. Some restrictions:
* Forage can only be used when enemy
action cuts the HQ’s trace supply. It
cannot be used by spearheads!
* Forage can only be used on the first
turn an HQ is out of trace supply.
After that, if still out of supply, it
must breakout, eat off the map, or
risk attrition.

***See Change Notes for more on how to
use this rule in older series games.***

## 21.11 Construction - B
This rule adds a bit more detail to the
rules for hedgehog construction and
port repair.

**21.11a Big Hogs.** Engineer-Capable
units are required to improve an existing
hedgehog—Level-1 is the limit of what
can be done by regular troops.

**21.11b Small Ports.** The cost of Port
Repair ([19.0d](../19-0-ports-and-shipping)) is reduced to the port’s
current capacity if damage has reduced
that capacity to under 1 SP. Example:
if the current (damaged) capacity is 2T,
it costs 2T to repair a level.

**21.11c Hog Reduction.** A hedgehog
is reduced by one level when captured.
(Note this applies only to hogs shown
by counters—hogs printed on the map
are handled normally.)

## 21.12 Transport - B

This first pair of rules adds a bit more
detail to the rules for Air and Sea Trans-
port. The next two are to ensure that
Strat Mode is used for redeployment,
not penetration.

**21.12a XYZ Transport Missions.** An
Air Transport mission is normally flown
from Base X to the “mission hex” at
Base Y, and from there to Base Z (where
plane goes inactive). Cargo is loaded at
X, unloaded at Y, and the transports
return empty to Z. The air units in a
mission can come from different X’s and
return to different Z’s, but in general
this is the procedure.

Under this enhancement, cargo can be
loaded at **both** X and Y (to full capacity
of aircraft at both stops), and cargo can
be unloaded at **both** Y and Z. Range of
an XYZ mission is figured as whichever
leg is longest (either X to Y or Y to Z).
Aircraft can return to different Base Z’s,
and come from different Base X’s.

In XYZ missions, Base Y and Base Z are
both “mission hexes” for the purpose of
flak and interception (so possibly two
of each), assuming loading/unloading
activity occurs.

**21.12b Cloak of Night.** Ports in an
EZOC are not completely shutdown
for Sea Cap. Under this option, a player
can still ship to/from these ports up to
their current capacity, but spends 4x the
normal Sea Cap to do so. This represents
night deliveries, etc.

**21.12c Strat Column Spacing.** Only
a maximum of 3 RE of units in Strat
Mode can end a segment in a given hex.
There can still be a total of 10 RE in
the stack; the new limit is just on Strat
Mode units. Units found in excess of
this limit are destroyed (owning player’s
choice). (**Exception**: a single multi-step
unit or multi-unit formation, even if it
is larger than 3 RE, can always end a
segment in Strat Mode in a hex.)

**21.12d Strat Direct Draw.** All units in
Strat Mode must end movement in a
hex where they can receive trace supply
via Direct Draw (not by “eating off the
map” or “HQ-Throw”).

***Game-Specific Note:** Don’t use Strat
Direct Draw (21.12d) in BALTIC GAP ,
which was designed for aggressive use of
Strat Mode.*

**21.12e. Air Transport DRMs.** Add
a terrain DRM to Air Transport Table:
* -1 if hex contains Very Close, OR
* -2 if hex contains Extremely Close.
