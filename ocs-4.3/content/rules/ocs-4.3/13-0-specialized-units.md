## 13.1 HQ Units

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/hq-units-13.1.png)

HQs are special combat units
that can distribute supplies,
rebuild units, and perform
engineering tasks. HQs are 1
RE in size, regardless of what is on the
unit designation.

**13.1a HQs and Modes.** The Combat
Mode side of an HQ has the greater
throw range. DG Mode ([5.10e](../5-0-modes/#510-disorganized-mode-dg)) does not
affect an HQ’s special functions ([13.1b](#131-hq-units)).
An HQ’s defense strength is determined
by mode (per [13.1c](#131-hq-units)). An HQ in Strat
Mode cannot throw supply ([5.8b](../5-0-modes/#58-strat-mode)).

***Design Note:** Combat Mode represents
an HQ having taken up residence; Move
Mode shows an HQ with a more mobile
status. When in Move Mode, the extra
trucks of the HQ are considered to be
shuttling around mechanics and bakers
instead of supplies.*

**13.1b HQ Special Functions.**
* An HQ can “throw” SP and trace
supply to combat units within its
throw range ([12.3b](../12-0-supply/#123-on-map-supply)).
* An HQ can rebuild units ([13.5a](../13-0-specialized-units/#135-replacement-units)).
* An Engineer-Capable HQ ([13.8a](../13-0-specialized-units/#138-engineer-functions))
can perform special functions such
as bridging, detrainable creation,
and construction.

**13.1c HQs and Combat.** HQs have
some ratings that are not printed on
the counters. Their Action Rating is 0.
In Combat Mode, they have a parenthesized 
(defensive-only) strength of 5,
and in Move Mode this is reduced to 1.

HQs need supply like any other combat
unit. They must change to Move Mode
when forced to retreat.

**13.1d Special HQs.** Games can have
HQs of multiple nationalities and/or
command levels. HQs are normally able
to throw supply to all friendly ground
units, without regard to historical chain
of command, but there may be limita-
tions in specific games. One exception
is series-wide: Divisional HQs can only
provide supply to their **own** division’s
units or to independent units (defined
in [3.2f](../3-0-units-and-markers/#32-combat-units)) of the same nationality.

## 13.2 Transport Points

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/transport-points-13.2.png)

Transport Points move SPs
across the map. Specialized
Combats involving these are
covered in [9.14c](../9-0-ground-combat/#914-specialized-combats).

**13.2a Sequencing Transport/Supply.**
A Transport Point can move, pause to
use some of its load, and then continue
moving. While “pausing” the carried SP
can be used to pay for all kinds of fueling
and construction/repair. There are two
important restrictions: the Transport
Point must finish moving before another
unit is moved, and upcoming combat/
barrage costs can never be pre-paid in
this fashion. SP need not be unloaded
from a Transport Point before being
used.

**13.2b Transport Points and Supply.**
Transport Points never need fuel and
are never Out of Supply.

**13.2c Mechanical Handling.** Transport 
Points can carry up to their size
in SP. Transport Points can combine
and divide within counter-mix limits.
Dividing or combining does not cost
MP, can only be done in the friendly
Movement Phase and only if all of the
involved Transport Points are in one
hex. The combined/divided Transport
Points can continue to move, but must
conform to the limitation imposed by
[6.1f](../6-0-ground-movement/#61-how-to-move-ground-units) 
(but see [12.7e](../12-0-supply/#127-extenders) and [12.7f](../12-0-supply/#127-extenders) for some
liberties given to Extenders). Different
types of Transport Points can never be
combined into a single counter, and
this restriction includes Organic Trucks,
which cannot combine with or divide
into regular Trucks. (**Exception**: Unit
Consolidation can be used to convert a
regular Truck into an Organic Truck,
per [13.9](#139-unit-consolidation.)

**13.2d Mode Restrictions.** Transport
Points are in Move Mode at all times
(never Combat, Strat, Reserve, DG, or
Exploit). (**Exception**: Organic Trucks
can enter Reserve Mode, per [13.2g](#132-transport-points).)

**13.2e** A Transport Point can be shipped
by sea or rail, but not by air. (**Exception**:
Mules, found in some games, **can** be
shipped via Air Transport.) The shipping
cost is always equal to the size of the
Transport Point, which can be transported 
**while loaded with SP** for the
same shipping cost.

**13.2f Loading and Unloading.** Place
loaded SP **under** the Transport Points
carrying them, and unloaded SP **above**
any Transport Points in the stack. A
Transport Point cannot be loaded via
direct-draw or via thrown SP—it must
be in the same hex as the dump. Note
SP can (in effect) be unloaded by direct-
draw as its load is used by nearby units
and HQs.

**Loading Requirements:** A Transport
Point can load in any hex.

**Unloading Requirements:** A Transport
Point can only unload in a hex which
contains a friendly combat unit, port, air
base, or existing unloaded supply dump.

**Costs:** A Transport Point pays 10%
of its printed MA to load/unload any
number of SP in a hex. Round the cost
normally (so a truck with 45 MA must
pay 5 MP to load or unload SP).

**13.2g Organic Trucks.** 

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/organic-trucks-13.2g.png)

A multi-unit
formation sometimes is given
special, attached Transport
Points. An Organic Truck is
handled like other Transport
Points, with several exceptions. Organic
Trucks...
* **A)** can **never** unload their SP on the
map,
* **B)** only allow units of the same multi-unit 
formation to draw their SP,
* **C)** can never be combined to form
Extenders,
* **D)** can be put into Reserve Mode (if
their hex gets a DG result, remove
the Reserve marker),
* **E)** can tag along with other retreating
combat units in their stack (but
cannot retreat alone),
* **F)** convert when captured into regular
Transport Points, and
* **G)** can withhold combat supply (see
[12.10a](../12-0-supply/#1210-internal-stocks)).

Players can use HQs to throw supply
from Organic Trucks to units of **that**
formation.

**13.2h Full Notation.** Some games have
Transport Points that have an “F” in
a yellow box on one side and no such
notation on the back. The “F” denotes
that the Transport Point is full, while
the other side shows it is empty (use
the empty side plus some tokens for a
partially loaded Transport Point).

**13.2i** Transport Points that are captured
(see [9.14c](../9-0-ground-combat/#914-specialized-combats)) in the Movement Phase can
move immediately. If captured in any
other phase, no movement is allowed
until the capturing side’s next Move-
ment Phase.

## 13.3 Railroads

Railroads are vital for the movement of
reinforcements and SP, and are often
integral to trace supply. There are usually
two types of railroad hexes, multi-track
and single-track. Some games also have
tracks of differing gauges (see [13.3f](../13-0-specialized-units/#133-railroads)).

**13.3a** Combat units, Transport Points,
and SP can be moved using Rail Cap
(13.3b). These are the only rail cargo
allowed—never aircraft, ships, hedge-
hogs, etc. See [4.7](../4-0-general-concepts/#47-transportation-equivalents) for the Transportation
Equivalents of various cargo. Each Rail
Cap point can transport **one** SP or RE
any distance by rail movement. There
are two possible modifications:
* If cargo is moved along a path that
includes one or more Trainbusting
zones, **double** the Rail Cap cost.
* If cargo is moved along a path that is
entirely multi-track rail hexes, **halve**
the normal Rail Cap cost.

**13.3b** Rail Cap is available every turn
at levels specified by the scenario rules.
It cannot be “saved” for use in another
Movement Phase. **Rail Cap can only
be used in the Movement Phase** (never
during Reaction or Exploitation).

**13.3c Detrainable Hexes.** A railroad
hex is detrainable if it meets **all** of these
requirements:
* It has a village, city (any size), port,
or Engineer-Capable HQ ([13.8a](#138-engineer-functions)).
* It is under control ([13.3h](#133-railroads)).
* It has a rail path free of enemy ZOC
back to a supply source. Extender
links can be part of this for trace
supply, but not for moving cargo.
Note EZOC **cannot** be negated to
move cargo, but **can** to connect with
a supply source.

**13.3d Railheads.** 

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/railheads-13.3d.png)

Some games limit
each side’s railroad usage to
a certain gauge (or width) of
track ([13.3f](#133-railroads)). Show a divide
between gauges on the map
(as in “German gauge runs to here”)
with Railhead markers. (The flip-sides
are marked Wrong Gauge to help mark
complex junctions.) These markers are
**only** moved by the conversion work of
Rail Repair units— other ground units
moving through rail hexes have no effect
on the position of a Railhead.

Some games have only one gauge of
railroad track. In these, players can use
Railhead markers to show the forward
extent of rail hexes under their control.
(The initial extent of each side’s rail lines
is sometimes given in the scenario rules,
but keep in mind that [13.3h](#133-railroads) usually
makes railheads unnecessary.)

**13.3e** Rail movement includes three
steps: entrain, move, detrain. All three
steps must be done in the same phase.
* **1)** To entrain, the cargo must be in
a detrainable railroad hex ([13.3c](#133-railroads))
that is not in an enemy ZOC. A
unit moving by rail must be in
Move Mode, and can expend up
to half its MA in the phase **before**
entraining. Reinforcements and
new SP can entrain “off-map” if
their arrival hex contains a railroad
([13.6b](#136-reinforcements)).
* **2)** To move, the cargo follows a path
of connected rail hexes that does
not enter a hex with an enemy
combat unit or ZOC. Rail hexes
that are wrong gauge ([13.3f](#133-railroads)) or
uncontrolled ([13.3h](#133-railroads)) cannot be
used.
* **3)** To detrain, cargo must be in a
detrainable railroad hex which is
not in an enemy ZOC. No further
movement is allowed by a unit
after it detrains (per [4.7d](../4-0-general-concepts/#47-transportation-equivalents)).

***Design Note:** Rail capacity involves the
marshaling of rolling stock and a lot of
time spent loading and unloading. Rail
movement is a strategic asset; it is much
more efficient to move loads across long
distances rather than in short hops.*

**13.3f Rail Conversion.** In games with
more than one rail gauge, a side can only
use its rail capacity or supply line trace
along rail lines of a particular gauge.
Eligible Rail Repair units ([13.3g](#133-railroads)) are
used to convert rail lines to the gauge
appropriate to their side. Players keep
track of the current extent of each rail
gauge using Railhead markers.
* **A)** Railroads cannot be converted in
an enemy ZOC (no negation).
* **B)** A Rail Repair unit can convert a
rail hex simply by moving into it.
Conversion **does not** cost SP or
extra movement points.

**13.3g Rail Repair Units.** Rail Repair
units are combat units that are used to
convert railroad hexes. Several special
rules govern them:
* **A)** A Rail Repair unit can combine
rail movement with conversion in
the Movement Phase. (**Exception:**
They **cannot** do so if the hexes
being used for rail movement were
converted in the current phase. No
leapfrogging!)
* **B)** Rail Repair units can move their
full MA **after** using rail movement
(less any movement done prior
to entraining), and can use rail
movement in Combat Mode.
* **C)** Rail Repair units can entrain and
detrain in any railroad hex (it need
not be “detrainable”).
* **D)** Rail Repair units can convert up
to 4 hexes (or hexes equal their
current MA, if less than 4) during
the Movement Phase (not other
phases). They must be in Combat
Mode, or be in DG Mode and
oriented toward Combat Mode
(per [5.10e](../5-0-modes/#510-disorganized-mode-dg)).

***Play Note:** Conversion is not restricted
to merely pushing forward the railhead
marking where standard and wide gauges
meet; Rail Repair units can, for example,
use Strat Mode to get ahead of the normal
re-gauging to start working on a forward
section of track. “No leapfrogging” is a
narrow restriction on not having a second
repair unit use rail movement on newly
converted track to extend the Railhead.*

**13.3h Railroad Control.** Players can
only trace “rail paths” ([13.3c](#133-railroads)) into or
through **detrainable hexes** they control.
Initial control is based on the front line
(use common sense). Control changes
when an enemy combat unit enters the
hex, or when the hex is now on the
enemy side of the front line (this needs
to be **clearly** the case; when there is any
doubt do not change control).

Note that gauge, enemy units, and ZOC
will further limit whether a rail path can
actually be used for trace supply or rail
transport.

***Play Note:** This supersedes all previous
game-specific Railroad Control rules. There
is no longer a need to move units through
every rail hex — control of detrainable
hexes is now the sole concern.*

## 13.4 Artillery Units

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/artillery-units-13.4.png)

Artillery units attack targets
within range using Barrage.
Barrage Strength is shown in
a yellow box (on the lower
left of the counter); range is printed
below the Action Rating. The Combat
Mode side of an artillery unit is the
one with the greater Barrage Strength.
Artillery units can move and fire in the
same phase.

See [10.0](../10-0-barrage/)for barrage rules.

**13.4a** Artillery in Reserve or Strat Mode
**cannot** barrage. Otherwise, artillery can
barrage in any Barrage Segment in which
they are eligible to act, given the needed
supply is paid.

**13.4b Artillery and Combat.** Artillery
units all have a parenthesized (defensive-
only) strength of 1 in both Combat or
Move Mode. This number is **not** printed
on the counters.

## 13.5 Replacement Units

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/replacement-units-13.5.png)

Players roll on their Variable
Replacement Table during
each of their Reinforcement
Phases. Replacements (Repls)
acquired by this roll are additions to the
turn’s regular Reinforcements. Repls
can be used as soon as they arrive or be
saved for later. They come in two types:
Equipment (Eq) and Personnel (Pax).
These are used to rebuild lost steps or
units. Repl counters are not intention-
ally limited by the counter-mix, and
as with SP both players share the same
generic counters so must take care to
remember who owns which.

Repls can **never** enter Combat Mode,
but can enter all other modes. They are
1/4 RE for stacking. Repls are Attack-
Capable and can be used to take combat
or barrage losses. Repls are independent
combat units and must be supplied and
fueled normally.

**13.5a Replacing Losses.** A Repl used to
replace losses must be in Move Mode.
Rebuilding costs vary by unit type and
size, and are summarized on each game’s
Rebuild Table. There are two general
kinds of rebuild possible during every
Reinforcement Phase.
* **1)** To rebuild a unit in the Dead Pile,
the required Repls must be in a
single hex at or within 2 hexes of
a friendly HQ. The HQ must be
in Combat Mode, or else be in
DG Mode and oriented toward
Combat Mode (per [5.10e](../5-0-modes/#510-disorganized-mode-dg)). The
hex may not be in an enemy ZOC
([4.5a](../4-0-general-concepts/#45-zone-of-control)). Remove the required Repls
and put the rebuilt unit in the hex.
* **2)** To rebuild an on-map unit that
has taken step losses, follow the
above procedure. In addition, the
unit being rebuilt must be stacked
with the Repls being used.

**13.5b** A reduced or eliminated multi-
step unit can have any number of steps
rebuilt in a turn (given required Repls).
Its supply status and mode have no effect
on rebuilding. Rebuilding does not cost
MP; place a newly-rebuilt unit in any
voluntary mode. Generally, only units in
the Dead Pile and on-map reduced units
can be rebuilt. Generics like Breakdown
units **cannot** usually be rebuilt (they are
returned to the pool when destroyed).

***Play Note:** We have found it wise to set
up a “training detachment” at a rear area
base. Use a “not-so-good” HQ for this, and
station incoming Repls adjacent to it. This
simplifies the problem of having to hunt
down Repls when you need them.*

**13.5c No-Rebuild Units.** Units with a
Yellow dot behind their AR cannot be
rebuilt and are removed permanently
when destroyed.

**13.5d One Repl for Two Units.** Some
very small units (which are listed on the
Rebuild Table) can be rebuilt in pairs
for only one Repl. If only one such unit
is available in the Dead Pile, one Repl
must still be expended.

**13.5e Truck Rebuilds.** Trucks (Organic
or regular) can be rebuilt at a cost of
1x Eq per truck. Only trucks that have
been destroyed (or captured) by enemy
action can be rebuilt in this way, so the
player can never have more trucks in
play than the scenario provides him.
Other Transport Point types (such as
wagons and mules) **cannot** be rebuilt
in this way.

**13.5f Air Replacements.** Some games
have tables that provide direct aircraft
step replacement. In games with no such
result available, players can use Eq to
replace air losses. Each Eq can rebuild
**two** aircraft steps. Expend the Eq at an
HQ and follow the normal rules with
this addition to [13.5a](#135-replacement-units): Air units can be
rebuilt at any friendly air base (it need
not be near the HQ) and arrive Active
from the Dead Pile.
* An aircraft can be rebuilt regardless
of flight conditions.
* An Eq cannot be “partially” used to
rebuild air units ([13.5d](#135-replacement-units)).

## 13.6 Reinforcements

Reinforcements are new units entering
the game via the Arrival Chart or the
Variable Reinforcement Table. They
are placed in their entry hexes during
the friendly Reinforcement Phase. The
player **cannot** delay the entry of reinforcements, 
so “forgotten” units never
arrive unless your opponent is very nice.
Reinforcing aircraft arrive Active on any
friendly Air Base.

**13.6a** Placement of reinforcements at
a port (which cannot be in an enemy
ZOC) is limited to its current capacity.
Ground units can be overstacked when
placed; aircraft arrivals must conform to
normal stacking rules ([14.2a](../14-0-air-power/#142-aircraft-movement) and [18.2a](../18-0-naval-power/#182-aircraft-carriers)).

**13.6b** Reinforcements can enter in any
voluntary mode. They can be placed in
hexes in an enemy ZOC (but note the
Port restriction in [13.6a](#136-reinforcements)), and can arrive
by rail (ignoring the usual “entraining”
requirements of [13.3e](#133-railroads)). If a map-edge
arrival hex is blocked by enemy units,
the reinforcements can be placed in the
nearest unblocked map-edge hex.

**13.6c** Organic Trucks **arrive** loaded.
Other Transport Points arrive loaded
only if SP are arriving at the same location that turn.

## 13.7 Formation Markers

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/formation-markers-13.7.png)

Each multi-unit formation
has a marker that can be used
to show the location of one
or more of the formation’s
units. Remove the actual units from the
map, and keep them anywhere convenient. 
This helps to reduce some of the
map’s counter density and tall stacks.

**Unless using option [13.7b](#137-formation-markers), players
should take pains not to use these
markers to “hide” formations from
one another.**

**Usage notes:**
* **A)** At least one of the Formation’s
units must be stacked with the
marker or the marker cannot be
on the map (except as a reminder
of Fueling). So “empties” cannot
be used as dummy formations.
* **B)** A Formation marker can only be
used to represent a stack of **that**
formation’s units. The units move
and fight normally; the marker just
shows their location. Units can
freely move into the marker (and
for convenience be kept off the
map), or from the marker be put
back on the map, at no additional
MP cost. Eligible units that stack
with a Formation marker are not
required to enter it (and be pulled
off the map).
* **C)** Units represented by a Formation
marker can be in different modes
and supply states. The required
markers can be put off-map with
the units or on-map in the Formation 
marker’s hex (whichever is
easiest). If some units in a hex are
in the same mode as some units
in the Formation marker, a single
marker can usually be used for
all. Just remember to think of the
off-map units as stacked where the
Formation marker is located.
* **D)** Formation markers have regular
and fueled sides. Players must use
the fueled side when the “forma-
tion” method of fuel cost is paid
(see [12.5c](../12-0-supply/#125-fuel-supply)).

**13.7a Supply Concerns.** Combat units
in a multi-unit formation must receive
trace and fuel supply from the same HQ
or the same direct-draw source. If this
is not possible:
* For trace supply, one part of the
formation can trace “for free” while
the rest must “eat SP” or become
Out of Supply (per [12.6d](../12-0-supply/#126-trace-supply)).
* For fueling, part of the formation
can use the “formation” method,
but the remainder will need to use
the “single-unit” method. See [12.5c](../12-0-supply/#125-fuel-supply).

**13.7b Fog of War Option.** If players
agree, the Formation markers can be
used to heighten the fog of war. Players
are allowed to “hide” a tank corps or
panzer division by putting its Formation
marker under other combat units in a
stack. Any such trickery must conform
to [4.8b](../4-0-general-concepts/#48-stacking) and [4.9a](../4-0-general-concepts/#49-fog-of-war)—the Formation needs
to be on top if it contains the stack’s
only ground units with a ZOC (and
one of its units needs to be revealed).

## 13.8 Engineer Functions

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/engineer-functions-13.8.png)

HQs and Engineers are the
**only** units that can perform
engineer functions (bridging,
construction, and creation of
detrainable hexes). Related unit types—
such as Rail Repair, Assault Engineers,
Pioneers, and Para/Glider Engineers—
**cannot** perform the tasks listed in this
section.

**13.8a Engineer-Capable.** For it to be
considered Engineer-Capable, an HQ
or Engineer must be in **Combat Mode**,
or else be in DG Mode and oriented
toward Combat Mode (per [5.10e](../5-0-modes/#510-disorganized-mode-dg)).

**13.8b Bridging.** When **adjacent** to a
Major River, an Engineer-Capable unit
automatically reduces the MP cost of
Major River hexsides to that of Minor
River hexsides. Likewise, an Engineer-
Capable unit downgrades Minor River
hexsides to “no additional cost.” There is
no SP cost. Only friendly units moving
into or out of the Engineer-Capable
unit’s hex benefit from these reduced
movement costs. Apply bridging effects
to frozen rivers as appropriate.

Attacking units **cannot** use the bridging
function to cross a hexside to **overrun**
across a river. Bridging has no effect on
combat terrain modifiers, but can enable
an attack where none would be possible
without a bridge.

Bridging will disappear the instant a unit
is no longer Engineer-Capable. (**Exception:**
An Engineer-Capable unit can
use its own bridge to leave the hex after
losing its Engineer-Capable status by
changing mode or orientation.)

**13.8c Detrainable Creation.** This is
a special ability of HQ units only, not
other engineers. When an Engineer-Capable 
HQ occupies a functioning
railroad hex it automatically makes the
hex detrainable ([13.3c](#133-railroads)). There is no SP
cost.

This special detrainable status disappears 
the instant a mode change makes
the HQ no longer Engineer-Capable.
(**Exception:** An Engineer-Capable HQ
can entrain itself before switching to
Move Mode.)

**13.8d Construction.** In the Movement
Phase (only), an Engineer-Capable unit
can perform construction within a 2-hex
radius (enemy ZOC are ignored, and
terrain affects this path as if using Leg
MP). Tasks are build/improve/reduce an
Air Base ([15.3](../15-0-air-bases/#153-building-air-bases)) or Hedgehog ([16.0b](../16-0-hedgehogs/)),
and repair/damage a Port ([19.0d](../19-0-ports-and-shipping/)). An
Engineer-Capable unit cannot move in
the phase it performs construction.

Construction limits and notes:
* An Engineer-Capable unit can only
perform construction in a single hex,
and can only perform one type of
construction.
* All of the build/improve/repair tasks
have an SP cost. The reduce/damage
tasks are free of cost.
* Construction is immediate, so for
instance a new airfield can be used
in the same phase it is built.

***Design Note:** A large portion of engineer
capability is tied to HQ units. In real
life, these engineers typically spend most
of their time doing their assigned tasks. In
games, all too frequently, they end up as
poor excuses for infantry units and their
original task is forgotten. The idea here
is to prevent such misuse by eliminating
most non-combat engineer units from the
counter-mix.*

## 13.9 Unit Consolidation

A player can combine crippled formations 
during his Reinforcement Phase.
Units may be consolidated when adjacent 
to enemy units and when Out of
Supply. Ground units being exchanged/combined 
must be **identical** on both
sides of the counter, and a unit involved
in a consolidation cannot have Low or
Exhausted internal stocks, or be DG.
There are four types of Consolidation:
* **1)** To consolidate multi-step units,
the two units must be in the same
hex (or off-map box). Remove one
of the units and change the step
losses on the remaining unit to
reflect the steps added to it. No
unit can be rebuilt beyond full
strength in this manner—excess
steps would be lost.
* **2)** To consolidate multi-unit formations, 
the player can swap any unit
(including an Organic Truck) for
the equivalent unit of a different
multi-unit formation that is in the
Dead Pile. Modes and markers
stay the same, and SP loaded on
an Organic Truck remain loaded
(which does allow the supply to
be passed to the other division).
* **3)** An independent unit (including
regular Transport Points) can be
made part of a multi-unit formation 
(similar to #2 above), but a
unit from a multi-unit formation
can never be converted into an
independent unit.
* **4)** Two reduced aircraft of the same
type, values, and status (Active or
Inactive) can combine into a full
strength aircraft if they are in the
same hex (or off-map box). This
can be done during any phase (not
just the Reinforcement Phase).
