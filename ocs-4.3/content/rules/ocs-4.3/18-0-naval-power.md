**Skip this entire section if the game
being played does not include ships!**

Naval warfare is handled fairly simply,
because the series is built around land
and air combat. However, some detail
in naval operations is needed to allow
for campaigns with an important naval
component (specifically naval gunfire
support and amphibious landings).

## 18.1 General Naval Rules

**18.1a Supply.** Ships never need supply.

**18.1b Stacking.** There is no limit to
the number of ships that can stack in
a hex. Ships cannot stack with enemy
ships. Ships can enter hexes with enemy
non-combat units, but cannot stack with
enemy combat units (see [4.8c](../4-0-general-concepts/#48-stacking)).

**18.1c Naval Movement.** Most ships
can only enter all-sea hexes. Landing
Craft can additionally move in coastal
hexes and in either hex bordering an
**estuary** (see note below), even if it looks
like they are crossing all-land hexsides.

***Play Note:** An Estuary is a sea hexside
near the coast. It is often, but not always,
marked with a prohibited hexside. The rule
allowing landing craft to move along an
estuary **does not** apply to rivers or canals!*

***Specific Game Note:** In THE BLITTZKRIEG 
LEGEND Destroyers are allowed move into a
port. This is an exception to normal rules.
A large ship is automatically DG in a port,
which makes it more susceptible to damage
(since another DG converts to a loss).*

**18.1d Naval DG.** Ships do not have
modes, but they do use DG markers
to show an increased vulnerability to
damage (see [18.3d](#183-naval-combat)). DG markers are
removed from ships during the player’s
Clean Up Phase. Note that ship values
are not affected.

**18.1e Phasing.** Ships can move during
friendly Movement, Exploitation, and
Reaction Phases, and expend 1 MP per
hex. Every ship can move in all three
phases (no need for Reserve markers).

**18.1f** Speed. Most ships can move 20
hexes per phase. **Slow** ships (designated
with a **white stripe**) can only move 10
hexes per phase. A damaged single-ship
counter converts to slow speed, but a
damaged multi-ship counter (destroyers
and cruisers) retains its normal speed.
These changes are reflected on a coun-
ter’s damaged side.

***Design Note:** The speeds above are indeed
“slow” given regular steaming rates. They
exist here not as a measure of how fast the
ships can go, but rather as a measure of
flexibility. Ships dedicated to an operation
cannot instantly shift focus as would be the
case if they had a movement rate matching
their potential steaming distance.*

## 18.2 Aircraft Carriers

**18.2a Capacity.** 

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/aircraft-carriers-18.2a.png)

Carriers are limited
in the number and type of
aircraft they carry. In some
games, only planes with the
carrier’s name on them can
use that carrier. In other games, each
carrier has a number on it for how many
aircraft it can support (counting both
Inactive and Active aircraft).

**18.2b Refit.** Carriers can refit **all** of
their planes in the Aircraft Refit Phase.
**Exception:** Damaged carriers can only
refit 2 planes (regardless of their normal
rating). There is no SP cost.

**18.2c Carrier Planes.** Air units on a
carrier perform missions and project
Patrol Zones from the carrier’s hex. A
carrier can move in the same segment,
either before or after, its planes perform
missions. Aircraft stay with a carrier as
it moves—and this includes a “move”
to the Dead Pile. (Note tagging along
with a moving carrier is **not** treated as
a mission.) Otherwise, carrier planes
operate as regular aircraft.

**18.2d** Surface ship gunfire **cannot** be
directed at a carrier if any non-carrier
surface ships are in range. This rule does
**not** apply to coastal artillery gunfire
([18.3g](#183-naval-combat)).

***Design Note:** This rule shows the effort
by members of a carrier group to defend
the carrier. A surface attack will not get to
the carrier until the screen is eliminated.*

## 18.3 Naval Combat

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/naval-combat-18.3.png)

Ships attack enemy naval and
ground targets using barrage.
Anti-ship attacks of all kinds
are also resolved via barrage.

**18.3a Ship Barrages.** A ship is able
to barrage **once** per friendly Barrage
Segment, choosing either a ground or
naval target in range. There are some
restrictions:
* **A)** A ship can fire at naval targets in
every friendly Barrage Segment it
does not fire at a ground target.
* **B)** A ship can fire at enemy ground
targets only **once** per game turn.
For example, a ship that barrages
an enemy air base in its Reaction
Phase is unable to fire at a target
during Movement or Exploitation.

**18.3b Ground Targets.** Naval barrages
against ground units have reduced effects
as noted on the Barrage Table; barrages
vs. Facilities have no special reduction.
Ships firing together do not need to be
stacked together. See [18.3g](#183-naval-combat) for special
handling of Coastal Artillery.

**18.3c Naval Targets.** Enemy ships can
only be barraged by naval units, planes,
and Coastal Artillery. These barrages are
made against individual ships, not entire
stacks. There is no limit on the number
of barrage missions that can be directed
against ships in a single hex in a Barrage
Segment, but no ship can be targeted by
more than one barrage in a phase.

After announcing a barrage against a
stack of ships, the firing player is allowed
to see all the available ships (but not
their cargoes, if any) before selecting
individual targets. For example, a stack
of two aircraft could combine against
one ship or each attack a different ship.
(The strength of a barraging unit cannot
be split, however.) Resolve each barrage
independently, using the regular Barrage
Table. Several special rules apply when
barraging ships:
* **A)** The **only** possible shifts are those
related to an attacking aircraft’s
distance from its base.
* **B)** **Multiply** the Barrage Strength of
all attacking planes by x2.
* **C)** **Divide** the Barrage Strength of
all attacking units by the target’s
Protection Rating (treat as ‘1’ if
none is printed on the counter).
* **D)** All Landing Craft in a stack are
treated as “one individual ship”
for target and DG purposes.

**18.3d Naval Damage.** A ship is affected
by hits and DG results generated by the
Barrage Table. Damaged ships **cannot**
be repaired.
* **A)** Hits on Ships. A hit flips a ship to
its damaged side; a second sinks it.
Also apply a DG result to the ship
(see below).
* **B)** Hits on Landing Craft. Each hit
eliminates one point of the unit—
use a counter of a reduced value to
reflect the hit. (**Exception:** When
an LST takes a hit, **convert** the
counter to Landing Craft of the
reduced point value.) Also apply
a DG result (see below) to **all** the
Landing Craft in the hex.
* **C)** DG results. These results affect the
target only, not the entire hex or
any cargo. The first DG does not
cause damage, but on a second
DG remove the marker and then
apply a hit (per “A” or “B”).

**Important Note:** A player conducting
a barrage selects its target if shooting
against ships. If firing against Landing
Craft, **randomly** determine the target.
Eliminated cargo is also randomly determined. 
For example: a 2-point DUKW
carrying a regiment and an SP takes a
loss. Reduce the DUKW to 1 point,
and then roll to see if the SP or the
regiment is lost.

**18.3e Torpedo Bombers.** 

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/torpedo-bombers-18.3e.png)

Air units with
a Barrage Strength in parentheses 
are Torpedo Bombers.
They can **only** barrage ships;
they can **never** barrage land
targets of any kind.

**18.3f Ship Flak.** The Flak value of a
ship (if any) is given on the counter.
This adds to the Flak rolls made against
all Air Barrage missions in the hex (not
just those targeting that particular ship).

**18.3g Coastal Artillery.** 

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/coastal-artillery-18.3g.png)

Coastal Artillery 
can fire as “land-based
ships” using the rules for ship
barrages (this includes being
exempted from supply use).
**They are the only ground units that
can barrage ships.**
* **A)** Coastal Artillery can fire at ships
in every friendly Barrage Segment
it does not fire at ground targets.
Resolve the barrages using 18.3c.
These have no supply cost.
* **B)** Coastal Artillery can **sometimes**
fire at ground targets in friendly
Barrage Segments. They cannot
fire at enemy ships in the same
phase, however, and all normal
rules for artillery barrage apply—
including mode/phase restrictions
and limits. These have the normal
supply cost.
* **C)** Ships can fire at Coastal Artillery
as a **naval target**, independent of
other units in the hex. (Or they
could do a regular barrage against
the hex, per [18.3b](#183-naval-combat).) Always treat
these as “spotted” barrages, with
Barrage Table results adjusted as
follows: a step loss eliminates the
Coastal Artillery unit and a DG
result is ignored.

***Design Note:** It is important that players
realize the abstractions represented in ship
vs. ship exchanges. Ship location at this
level is not all that precise—range changes
and gunfire exchanges happen in the hours
significantly “below” the resolution of this
system. This is **not** a tactical naval system!*

## 18.4 Landing Craft

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/landing-craft-18.4.png)

Landing Craft, DUKWs, and
LSTs are collectively called
“Landing Craft.” These are
naval units used to deliver
cargo (troops and supplies) to invasion
beaches. Landing Craft do not have a
Flak value or Barrage Strength.

**18.4a Capacity.** Landing Craft have
a capacity number on the counter and
function much like Transport Points.
They do not count for stacking.

**18.4b Movement.** Landing Craft are
slow ships ([18.1f](#181-general-naval-rules)). **Exception:** DUKW
can only move 8 hexes per phase.

**18.4c Loading.** Landing Craft can carry
combat units, SP, and Transport Points
up to the limit of their capacity (see
[4.7](../4-0-general-concepts/#47-transportation-equivalents) for Transportation Equivalents).
Loading has no movement cost, can
only be done in port hexes (subject to
current capacity), and the cargo cannot
have been moved **before** being loaded.

**Important Note:** Unloading is done
using Amphibious Landing ([18.5](#185-amphibious-landings)) or
Beach Assault ([18.6](#186-beach-assaults)) procedures.

**18.4d Handling.** Handle Landing Craft
like SP and Transport Points—they can
be split up and combined in various
combinations of points. When taking
losses, either from ALT results or from
barrage, just replace the current counter
with a Landing Craft of the reduced
number of points. LSTs are an exception
(see 18.3d).

**18.4e DUKWs.** 

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/dukws-18.4e.png)

In addition to being
Landing Craft, DUKWs can
operate as Transport Points
(see [13.2](../13-0-specialized-units/#132-transport-points); captured as a Truck
per [9.14c](../9-0-ground-combat/#914-specialized-combats)). When moving as
Transport Points, DUKWs lose their
ability to move in all three Movement
Segments, but their MA is **tripled** to
24. The switch between Landing Craft
and Transport Point (and vice versa) can
occur at any time during the Movement
Phase—just triple the remaining MA
when it starts to move by land (or divide
by 3 when it starts to move by water).

In addition...
* **A)** Make an ALT roll (see 18.5f) each
time the DUKW switches movement 
type from Landing Craft to
Transport Point (**not** vice versa).
This **can** be the same roll used to
unload cargo (but this will end
movement, per 18.5e).
* **B)** When acting as Landing Craft,
DUKWs can only carry the cargo
types allowed on Air Transport
Missions (restricted as per [14.9c](../14-0-air-power/#149-air-transport)).
Treat as a Landing Craft if overrun
(9.14g). Unloaded ground units
can move after landing (18.5h).
* **C)** When acting as Transport Points,
DUKWs can only carry SP. Treat
as a truck when overrun ([9.14c](../9-0-ground-combat/#914-specialized-combats)).
Loading/unloading cost is 2 MP
(per [4.7d](../4-0-general-concepts/#47-transportation-equivalents) and [13.2f](../13-0-specialized-units/#132-transport-points)).

**18.4f LSTs.** 

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/lsts-18.4f.png)

In addition to being a type
of Landing Craft, an LST in
a coastal or estuary hex can
be converted into a port (by
flipping to its port side). This
‘conversion’ requires an ALT roll (see
18.5f). Any cargo on the LST unloads
when it deploys as a port, using the same
ALT roll as the port deployment. (The
cargo is landed before the port exists in
the hex, so note the restrictions of [18.5e](#185-amphibious-landings)
**do** apply.)

Some special rules apply to LST ports:
* **A)** Unlike regular ports, they **cannot**
be targeted by barrage (the **hex** can
be barraged, but the port ignores
any result).
* **B)** They are destroyed when an enemy
Attack-Capable unit enters its hex.
They can never be destroyed or
captured by any other method.
* **C)** They can never move or convert
back into an LST.
* **D)** They are a 1 SP port, which makes
them a supply source.
* **E)** LST ports are **not** functional in
the phase they deploy. (So in that
phase no shipping is allowed into
the port and the port does not
assist other ALT rolls.)
* **F)** An LST cannot convert into a port
in a hex with another port.

## 18.5 Amphibious Landings

Landing Craft can unload the combat
units they are transporting when they
end movement in coastal hexes. The risk
attached to such landings is reflected by
the required roll on the Amphibious
Landing Table (ALT). These landings
are limited to undefended coastal hexes.
For hexes occupied by enemy combat
units, see Beach Assaults ([18.6](#186-beach-assaults)).

**18.5a** There is no movement cost for
unloading; just drop off the units when
the Landing Craft enters the coastal hex.
**The Landing Craft must end its move
at that point.**

**18.5b** Any number of Landing Craft
points can unload in a given hex in one
phase.

**18.5c** Combat units must unload in
either Combat or Move Mode.

**18.5d** Landings requiring an ALT roll
can **only** be done during the player’s
**Movement Phase**. Note that landings
in ports which do not require an ALT
roll can also be done in Reaction and
Exploitation Phases (see 18.5g) — this
is a way to get extra cargo ashore!

**18.5e** Transport Points and SP **cannot**
be landed by ALT roll (but see 18.5g).
SP loaded on Landing Craft can **only** be
used by units in the same or an adjacent
hex (even if off-shore), and HQs are **not**
allowed to “throw” supply drawn from
a Landing Craft.

**18.5f The ALT Roll.** Make ALT rolls
after **all** Landing Craft have finished
moving for the phase. Roll two dice per
hex containing units that landed during
the phase. Add applicable modifiers and
execute the result.
* **A)** When there are several types of
terrain in the hex, use the most
difficult on the ALT.
* **B)** Roll and carry out ALT results
separately for every group of 3 RE
landed in a hex. Make as few rolls
as possible, but otherwise a player
can arrange units into these groups
as desired.
* **C)** When partial losses are required by
the ALT result, randomly choose
the lost Landing Craft and cargo.
* **D)** Wait to do “after landing” moves
(18.5h) until **all** of the player’s
ALT rolls have been made.
* **E)** When entering a hex with enemy
non-combat units, resolve Specialized 
Combats (9.14) after making
the ALT roll.

**18.5g Ports.** Do not make an ALT
roll for Landing Craft that unload cargo
using a friendly port’s capacity ([19.0a](../19-0-ports-and-shipping/)).
(Additional units can be landed in a
port hex, but these **do** require an ALT
roll.) When no ALT roll is required,
SP and loaded Transport Points **can**
be unloaded.

**18.5h After Landing.** Combat units
can move 1/2 their MA during that same
Movement Phase **after** an ALT landing
(per [4.7d](../4-0-general-concepts/#47-transportation-equivalents)). Such units are fueled **before**
landing for free (at no SP cost) via the
“single-unit method” (see [12.5c(C)](../12-0-supply/#125-fuel-supply)).
DUKW can move a proportion of their
remaining MA (per 18.4e).
* Units that come ashore without an
ALT roll (via 18.5g) do not get any
after-landing movement.

## 18.6 Beach Assaults

Landing Craft can position units for an
assault on a coastal hex that contains
enemy combat units. Think of Beach
Assaults (BA) as a last resort, when landings 
via the ALT are not possible.

**18.6a** Resolve Beach Assaults during the
friendly Combat Phase. Several special
rules apply:
* **A)** The attacking units in a BA must
be in Combat Mode, stacked in
the same hex, and total no more
than 3 RE.
* **B)** Combat supply for a BA can be
drawn only from Landing Craft
carrying Supply Points in the same
or an adjacent hex.
* **C)** All atacker option results **must** be
taken as step losses.
* **D)** Units making a BA can keep any
Exploit marker they might earn.
* **E)** If the BA does not dislodge the
defenders from the hex, destroy
all attacking units and also their
Landing Craft.
* **F)** There is a nominal hexside terrain
that makes all units x1/2 when
attacking in a BA. The defender
can choose that or the hex terrain
in 9.4b.
* **G)** BA combats **cannot** be made in
conjunction with attacking units
that have already landed.
* **H)** If all of the defenders are destroyed
by a barrage, resolve the assault on
the ALT instead (but there is no
“after landing” movement).

**18.6b** Just before the execution of a BA,
the defending player can opt to resolve
the landing as an ALT instead of as a
BA. (This can be done if the odds are
overwhelming and an ALT roll has a
better chance of inflicting losses.) The
decision cannot be changed once made,
and must be made before any dice are
rolled, units exposed, or combat supply
paid. Spend no supply for a BA resolved
on the ALT.

If the defender makes this choice, the
normal ALT procedure is modified as
follows:
* Regardless of the ALT result, the
defenders are destroyed.
* Unloaded units advance into the
vacated hex, but there is no “after
landing” movement (per [4.7d](../4-0-general-concepts/#47-transportation-equivalents)).
