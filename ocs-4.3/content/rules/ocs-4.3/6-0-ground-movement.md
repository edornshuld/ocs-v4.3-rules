A player can move as many (or as few)
of his ground units as he likes during the
Movement Segment of his Movement
Phase. Subject to mode restrictions, a
player can also move them during the
Movement Segments of his Reaction
and Exploitation Phases. A unit can
move as many hexes as desired, subject
to MA, mode, fuel requirements, and
terrain.

## 6.1 How to Move Ground Units

Move units individually or in stacks.
Movement must follow a contiguous
path of hexes. A unit can move in any
direction or series of directions. Finish
movement of one unit (or stack) before
moving another. Regular combat does
not occur during movement, but units
can make overruns (a combined form of
movement and combat) while moving.

**6.1a Movement Points (MP).** Each
unit expends MP for each hex entered
and hexside crossed according to the
Terrain Effects on Movement Chart.
Keep a running MP total as each unit/stack moves.

**6.1b Movement Allowance (MA).** A
unit’s MA is how many MP it can spend
in a single phase. Modes can modify a
unit’s MA. Some units (including SP,
ports, air bases, and hedgehogs) have no
MA and thus cannot move or retreat.

**6.1c** If eligible to move in a phase, a
unit without enough MP can always
move a **minimum** of one hex. Units can
**never** use this rule to overrun, violate
restrictions imposed by their mode, or
move into or through prohibited terrain.
Only units with an MA greater than zero
can do this.

**6.1d** A unit can move from hex A to
hex B only if it could **also** move from
hex B to hex A. For example, a unit
prohibited from entering mountains
could not move from a mountain hex to
a clear hex through a non-road hexside.
Note the possible impact on overruns,
which cannot make use of roads ([8.1c](../8-0-overrun/#81-overrun-restrictions)).

**6.1e** The MA of units in a stack are
independent of each other, as are the
expenditures of stacked units of different
mobility classes. A player cannot transfer
MP (even if unused) from unit to unit,
or save them for later use.

**6.1f** A stack can begin moving together
and then split up by dropping units off
as it moves. Once dropped off, a unit
**cannot** move further, even if some of
its MA remains unused.

***Player Note:** Do not start moving as a
stack if you want the separate units to split
off and move elsewhere!*

**6.1g** Players **cannot** move units part of
their MA, move some others or conduct
an air mission, and then return to finish
the movement of the earlier (unfinished)
units. Once a unit begins to move, it
must continue until it is finished. Note
the minor exception for Transport Points
in [13.2a](../13-0-specialized-units/#132-transport-points).

**6.1h** The MA of units in certain modes
can be doubled, halved, or quartered
(see [5.7](../5-0-modes/#57-reserve-mode), [5.8](../5-0-modes/#58-strat-mode), and [5.10](../5-0-modes/#510-disorganized-mode-dg)). Never round a
reduced MA (retain the fraction).

## 6.2 Terrain Effects

Per the Terrain Effects on Movement
Chart, each hex and hexside feature costs
a specific number of MP. To enter a
hex, a moving unit must pay the full
required cost. (**Exception:** minimum
moves, [6.1c](#61-how-to-move-ground-units).) The hex or hexside MP
cost will vary depending on the mobility
type ([3.1a](../3-0-units-and-markers/#31-ground-units)) of the unit: Leg, Tracked,
or Truck.

***In all cases below, the word “road”
encompasses every kind of road-like
feature (tracks, railroads, and roads
of various quality):***

**6.2a** Roads can be used if moving units
are following a continuous road path.
**A unit then pays the road movement
cost and ignores other features in the
hexes or hexsides crossed.** There is no
requirement for the roads to intersect
**within** a hex in order to leave it via
any of them—roads and railroads are
considered to be linked in a common
hex even if it is not literally shown as
such on the map.

**6.2b** Add the cost of hexside features—
these have additive costs (such as ‘+3’)
on the Terrain Chart—crossed to that
of the hex entered. (**Exception**: units
moving along a road *8* hexside
features.) Note that Bridging ([13.8b](../13-0-specialized-units/#138-engineer-functions))
can be used to reduce the cost of rivers.

**6.2c** Ground units cannot enter or cross
prohibited hexes and hexsides (unless
using a bridge or road). Destroy units
forced to do so. See also [6.1d](#61-how-to-move-ground-units).

**6.2d Multiple Terrain Types.** Some
hexes contain more than one type of
terrain. Use the terrain in the hex which
is **most costly** for movement (unless
following a road, per [6.2a](#62-terrain-effects)). The amount
of symbol in the hex does not matter (so
even a little nub of mountain makes it a
mountain hex). **Exception:** Ignore city
and village nubs.

Water terrain has a few exceptions:
* A moving unit ignores water terrain
along a shoreline if there is any land
terrain on the hexside crossed.
* A moving unit uses the **cheapest
water terrain** along a hexside being
crossed, such as when a hexside is
part lake and part river.
* Rivers are intended to fully cover
hexsides, so ignore nubs.

## 6.3 Restrictions on Movement

**6.3a** Only the designated player can
move his ground units during a given
phase. For instance, only the non-
phasing player’s units can move during
the Reaction Phase.

**6.3b Enemy Contact.** Unless negated,
an enemy ZOC stops movement of a
Truck MP unit (see [4.5a](../4-0-general-concepts/#45-zone-of-control)). Units can
*sometimes* move into hexes containing
enemy units (see [4.8c](../4-0-general-concepts/#48-stacking)).
