Roll for weather during the Weather
Determination Segment.

**17.0a** Weather affects play according to
the effects (if any) listed with the game-
specific Weather Table.

**17.0b** Weather generally affects each
player equally (in some games it can
affect one side or the other differently).

**17.0c** Weather conditions that increase
the normal movement costs are ignored
when tracing supply paths ([12.3d](../12-0-supply/#123-on-map-supply)).

**17.0d** In a change to some older game
rules, weather can **never** prohibit refit,
or prevent aircraft from being Active at
their base.
