Air Base units are the ground
support establishments (fuel
tanks, runways, and hangers)
for air units. Each air base has
a Level representing its size, and in some
games a small triangle to allow a player
to displace the counter from its actual
hex in congested areas.

Air bases are non-combat units, so it
takes an Attack-Capable enemy unit
to enter these hexes. **See [9.14f](../9-0-ground-combat/#914-specialized-combats) for air
base capture.**

**15.0a** No more than one air base can
ever exist in a single hex.

**15.0b** Air Base Level effects:
* **A)** Each Level allows the refit of two
aircraft per Aircraft Refit Phase.
For instance, a Level-3 Air Base
can refit up to six air units.
* **B)** Air bases have Flak Points equal
to their Level.
* **C)** Only 2T times the Level can be
unloaded per Movement Segment
(unlimited if the Transports in
excess of this amount go Inactive
at the base, or if it is an Air Drop
or glider operation).There is no
limit on loading.
* **D)** The stacking limit of **Active** air
units in an air base hex is 4 + the
Level. (There is no limit on Inac-
tive aircraft.)

**15.0c** When attacked on the Barrage vs.
Facility Table, an air bases may take hits
which reduce their Level. **However, no
air base can be reduced below Level 1
(even in games using Air Strips).**

**15.0d** Air Bases never need trace supply
and never suffer attrition.

## 15.1 Refitting Aircraft
* **A)** An air base can refit once during
the Aircraft Refit Phase.
* **B)** Refit costs 1T at each base (regard-
less of Air Base Level or number
of aircraft involved). An air base
can refit up to **double** its Level in
aircraft. The player chooses which
Inactive aircraft to refit. Every air
unit counts as one for refit, even
when at reduced strength.
* **C)** An air base cannot refit aircraft in
an un-negated enemy ZOC.
* **D)** Weather conditions never prohibit
refit, and never prevent aircraft
from being Active. (This series rule
intentionally modifies the weather
rules in some older games!)

## 15.2 Air Strips

Air Strips are *very small* air bases that can
be built/used only if specifically allowed
in a game’s rules. Air Strips have some
special characteristics:
* **A)** They are built for 1T, following
the procedure in [15.3](#153-building-air-bases). An air strip
can be upgraded to a Level-1 Air
Base by paying 3T.
* **B)** They can only refit one aircraft per
Aircraft Refit Phase.
* **C)** They have a unloading capacity of
2T per Movement Segment.
* **D)** They have a stacking limit of 4
Active air units.
* **E)** They are never reduced by damage
or voluntary reduction.
* **F)** They do not add any Flak.

## 15.3 Building Air Bases

Air bases can be built/improved only
during the Movement Phase, and only
by Engineer-Capable units performing
Construction ([13.8d](../13-0-specialized-units/#138-engineer-functions)). The cost is 1 SP.
* An Air Base’s Level can **increase**
by only one per turn (such as from
none to Level-1, or from Level-1 to
Level-2). It thus takes three turns
and 3 SP to build a Level-3 Air Base.
* Air bases can **never** be improved
above Level-3.

## 15.4 Reduction of Air Bases

Air bases can be reduced only during the
Movement Phase. One RE of units, that
are in Combat Mode and do not move,
can reduce an air base by one Level. An
Engineer-Capable unit can also do the
work ([13.8d](../13-0-specialized-units/#138-engineer-functions)). There is no SP cost.
* A given friendly air base can only be
reduced **once** per phase.
* An air base can **never** be reduced
below Level-1.
* Note that a Facility Table Barrage
can also reduce air bases (see [10.0c](../10-0-barrage/)).
