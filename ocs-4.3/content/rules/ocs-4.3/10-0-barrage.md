Artillery, ships, and aircraft use barrages
to attack enemy units and facilities. Use
the barrage table appropriate for the
target. Although more than one unit can
attack in the same barrage, only units of
the same general type—artillery, naval,
or air—can combine in a single barrage.

Barrages occur in the Barrage Segments
of the Movement, Reaction, Combat,
and Exploitation Phases. If a side’s air
units are allowed to perform Hip Shoot
missions (see [14.7d](../14-0-air-power/#147-barrage--hip-shoots)), these barrages are
made during Movement Segments of
those phases. Any number of artillery
units or ships, or up to four aircraft, can
participate in a single barrage.

The following general procedure is used
in all types of barrages (air, artillery,
and naval) and when using either of
the barrage tables. Total the Barrage
Strengths firing, determine the correct
column on the table, expend supply
per the amount listed on that column
(for artillery firing only), and adjust the
column per the table’s notes. Roll two
dice and apply the result.

**Important Note:** It takes at least one
point to “get on the table” (before shifts
are applied). Zero-point barrages are
not allowed!

**10.0a Barrage Table.** Use the Barrage
Table to conduct barrages against enemy
combat units. The primary goal is to
DG them.

The targeted player picks the terrain to
be used for possible shifts. He also selects
which combat units in the stack absorb
any resulting step losses.

Note a single division (even a multi-unit
formation) never counts as more than 3
RE for possible density shifts. (Use the
actual amount, if less than 3 RE.)

***Play Hint:** Roll three dice at once—the
two “barrage” dice plus the off-colored
“rounding” die (for possible “1/2” results)
to speed barrage resolution and play.**

**10.0b Spotter Restrictions.** A “correct
spotter” for a barrage is any friendly
combat unit adjacent to the target hex
that is **not** loaded on a landing craft.
* Barrage Table attacks made without
a correct spotter are penalized by a
3-column shift.
* Hip Shoots (on **either** table) cannot
be made at all unless they have a
correct spotter.
* Spotting does not affect the Barrage
vs. Facility Table (aside from the
Hip Shoot restriction).

**10.0c Barrage vs Facility Table.** Use
this table for a barrage against a facility-
type target. The player must pre-desig-
nate his specific target: Air Base or Port
(or Trainbusting for that specialized air
mission). No modifiers or terrain shifts
apply to these barrages, and they do
not need spotters. Roll a single die to
determine the result.

* **A) Air Base Targets**
A parenthesized result (“\#”) means
the attacking player should check
**all** enemy planes in the hex for
losses. Roll separately for each. If
the roll is ≥ the (\#), the air unit
takes a loss.
On a numbered result (“1” or “2”),
reduce the Air Base by that number
of levels, down to a minimum of
Level 1. Note that Airstrips are
never reduced.
* **B) Port Targets**
Numbered results (“1” and “2”)
generate damage; no other result
has any effect. Ports accumulate
damage, up to a maximum of four
hits, which steadily decrease the
Port’s capacity ([19.0b](../19-0-ports-and-shipping/)).
* **C) Trainbusting**
A “\*” result is needed to place a
Trainbusting marker in the hex;
other results have no effect. These
markers affect enemy rail transport
and ground movement, per 14.8c.
A Trainbusting marker is removed
during the next enemy Clean Up
Phase.

**10.0d Barraging Mixed Target Hexes.**
Hexes will often contain targets that are
affected in different ways by different
barrage tables. As such, in any barrage
the attacking player must announce a
general target (such as “combat units”
or “Port”) and apply the Barrage Points
to that target **only**. An example would
be a hex containing combat units, an
Air Base, and a Port. The player can use
the Barrage Table to attack the combat
units **or** the Barrage vs. Facility Table
to attack either the Port **or** the Air Base
(but not all at once).

**10.0e Barrage Limits and Phasing.**
Several restrictions are placed on the
conduct of barrages by certain units and
in certain phases.
* **A)** Regardless of how many different
types of targets are in a hex, only
one barrage per hex is allowed in
each phase. (**Exceptions**: Anti-
ship barrages and Hip Shoots.)
Note a declared mission that is
completely destroyed/aborted by
Flak or Interception does count
against this limit.
* **B)** A unit can only barrage once per
phase and cannot split its strength
between several barrages or fire at
less than its printed strength.
* **C)** Only air and naval barrages can be
performed during the Movement
Phase, mainly during its Barrage
Segment (the exceptions are Hip
Shoots, which occur during the
Movement Segment).
* **D)** Only artillery can barrage during
the Combat Phase.
* **E)** All types (air, naval, and artillery)
can barrage during the Reaction
and Exploitation Phases.
* **F)** A barrage can use only a **single
type** of barraging unit: either air,
naval, or artillery.

## 10.1 Artillery Barrages

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/artillery-barrages-10.1.png)

**10.1a** Artillery barrage ranges
are given in hexes. These are
unaffected by weather and
terrain. An artillery unit with
a range of ‘3’ can barrage targets from 1
to 3 hexes away.

**10.1b Supply Cost.** Expend combat
supply to conduct an **artillery** barrage
at the moment of the barrage. The cost
is given near the top of the appropriate
table; use the cost on the barrage’s initial
column (before any shifts). If the SP
required to fire the barrage is unavailable, 
do not execute the barrage. (There
is no penalty—the units selected for a
cancelled barrage are not considered to
have fired.)
* **A)** Supply for a multi-unit barrage
must come from the same HQ,
or from the same supply dump if
no HQ is used.
* **B)** Artillery units still use their full
Barrage Strength when marked
Out of Supply (assuming needed
combat supply is available).
* **C)** Barrages can never be made using
internal stocks.

***Example:** Two artillery battalions, within
range, barrage a hex. The total Barrage
Strength is 16. The firing player identifies
the column on the Barrage Table (12-16).
That table requires 3T to fire. The player
pays 3T to execute the shot. Checking for
modifiers, he finds the target hex contains
8 RE and a Level-1 Hedgehog, in close
terrain. An appropriate spotter is adjacent
to the target hex. The total column shift
applied to the initial column is two to the
right (4 right for density, one left for the
hedgehog, and one left for the terrain). This
gives a final table column of 25-40. The
player rolls two dice and obtains an 8. The
result is [1/2]. In this case, as neither of
the conditions for a bracketed result apply
(there is a correct spotter and the target is
not in a Level-3 or greater Hedgehog),
the result is treated as a regular “1/2.”
The firing player rolls one die and gets a
3. The target hex does not lose any steps,
but is Disorganized.*

## 10.2 Air Barrages

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/air-barrages-10.2.png)

An air barrage is similar to
an artillery barrage, but has
no supply cost. See [14.7](../14-0-air-power/#147-barrage--hip-shoots) for
more details.

**10.2a Air Barrages and Phasing.** Air
units are placed on targets and resolve
their barrages in the various Barrage
Segments (except for Hip Shoots, which
occur during the Movement Segments).
The aircraft **must** return to a base and
become Inactive immediately afterward
([14.1c](../14-0-air-power/#141-aircraft--basic-handling)). Planes conducting a barrage are
subject to Interception ([14.5](../14-0-air-power/#145-interception)) and Flak
([14.4](../14-0-air-power/#144-flak)) before conducting the barrage.
Hip Shoots ([14.7d](../14-0-air-power/#147-barrage--hip-shoots)) are governed by
various special rules.

**10.2b Short Range Effect.** If all aircraft
conducting a barrage are at or within 10
hexes of their base, they get an additional
shift to the right on the regular Barrage
Table. **Exception:** Never apply this shift
to Strat Bombers.

**10.2c** There is no supply cost for an
air barrage.

## 10.3 Naval Barrages

![](/rules/ocs-4.3/files/naval-barrages-10.3.png)

Barrages by naval units (as
well as all forms of anti-ship
combat) are covered in [18.3](../18-0-naval-power/#183-naval-combat).
There is no supply cost.
